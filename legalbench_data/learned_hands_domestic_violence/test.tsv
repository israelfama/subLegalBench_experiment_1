0	OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A THROWAWAY  Long story short, we reconciled after a period of not talking and went out drinking with one of her friends. Me and her went home, both pretty drunk, and during an argument (after a sex/kink scene that went really poorly and I ended up bleeding and in serious pain with no aftercare on her part), she smothered me with a pillow in order to get me to stop talking so she could sleep. I finally stopped fighting and she let up, and we both went to sleep. Later, I woke her up telling her how much she hurt me, and she said if she hurt me so much, then I should just get out and press charges.  I know she wasn't serious about me pressing charges and she was just trying to be mean by saying that (she knows I have a history of being the victim in a violent relationship and being scared about getting legal intervention) but I'm thinking about it now a week later. I remember thinking I was going to die at the hands of someone who said they loved me and how scared I was. Every time I've confronted her about it since then, she's ignored it and I have the screenshots for it (all confrontations were via text).   I don't think I have enough evidence, especially a week out, but I'm really scared that she will do this again to someone else. I know she is seeing someone else and I already warned them anonymously, but I'm still scared that she will do it again to someone unknowing. Should (can I??) press charges, or do I have no power in this situation anymore?	Yes
1	Charges are against my ex. Cops/EMS were called for someone else that my ex assaulted (but they never talked to that person or got a statement). I was caught in the crossfire and they were more interested in what happened to me even though it wasn't anything super serious. I don't want to testify for various reasons. I don't want to deal with it anymore or even think about it, (I have an anxiety disorder and PTSD so would like to avoid having to be around him) and I'm sort of afraid of what ex's girlfriend would do to me if he got locked up because she's made threats before. Ex already has two felony convictions for drugs and served time in prison because of it.  I'm not sure how the process works, but I have to be there tomorrow. Would I get any charges or anything for refusing to testify against him?	Yes
2	I witnessed my (Indonesian) wife attempt to murder our daughter (Two YO), forcing her to drink bleach. Daughter recovered.  I told my mother then and wife confessed to her days later also.  Wife has disappeared with daughter now, demanding ransom over the phone ($20k). I have no legal recourse currently there, and no escape path for her.  I want my elderly mother's witness to my wife's confession to her reported legally, ASAP.  It may be useless, however some day I hope at least that my daughter could see the confession, documented at law firm here.   Could you please recommend a service type?	Yes
3	"I have never been arrested or charged with anything in my life, my attacker was my brother who is 70lbs heavier then me and convicted of armed robbery quite a few years ago, was assaulted in my residence.  also, state is NJ  basic gist:  -I live in residence with my mother   -discover ~800$ worth of xbox stuff is missing with the ottoman i stored the items in.   -99% sure my brother who no longer lives at the residence stole them   -Text him to return my objects or i am calling police (have this text still)   -my mom was on the phone with him and he says he is coming to beat me up essentially. -I go to leave but his house is very nearby, he parks behind my car.   - i go back inside with 911 dialed for when he strikes me which i knew was inevitable, but i was hoping to deter him and just tell him to leave.   -tell him to leave, he grabs me by throat, slams my head into a wall which cracks, slams me into opposite side wall twice and tries to throw me down stairs.   - i call 911 just as he grabs me, sometime during the altercation i say ""i am calling 911 you idiot, get off me"" -he lets go after that immediately and paces in front of the front door so he can speak to police first. (i recorded this)   -I'm adopted and not white, my brother is white 70lbs heavier then me, and was once convicted of armed robbery. cops who showed up are white, one had a vendetta against me since i put a couple holes in the wall last year and my mom called the police but decided not to press charges.   -I had scrapes all over my shoulder and back, along with bruising. -he had a cut on his lip, i admitted to probably causing it trying to get him off of me during the altercation by pushing against his face, cops wrote down i punched him. -was in pain in holding cell at the town holding cell, waved to camera for assistance, asked for medical attention and they threatened me. - where do i go from here? I've never been arrested in my life, i can't exactly afford a lawyer, i feel like a lawyer will only help me if they believe there is a lawsuit involved. Which sure, I wouldn't complain, but I'm really mostly worried about my record and future being ruined for calling for help while being attacked in my own home...  do you think the text and him showing up to assault me in the house i live in, he doesn't, literally 10 minutes later would be able to prove anything? or even the fact i was the one who called 911 and had way worse injuries? I even have pictures of bruising on my throat from being strangled. all the way on both sides and underneath."	Yes
4	(Scranton, PA)I received an email in my university email account about a job offer. This job included getting this man clothes, his mail, sending payments on his behalf, and shopping. In turn he said he would pay me $400 a week, and be sending me checks to do this, as well as send money for me to pay his bills.   I just received a check yesterday, enough to pay me and pay for his other needs. however, the check isn't from the name he told me and the address and name on the label on the envelope has a different name and address then from what I was told it was. The name and address were matched with someone from PR but I was told my employer lived in Boston. Is this fake? Would I get in any legal trouble if I attempted to cash it?	Yes
5	Little backstory is important.  We obtained our green card (mom and her son (me)) through marriage with him. He has started drinking last months more and more and he is just gettibg more aggressive. We don't know what to do. This morning he threatened my mother and she was able to record it. He said he is going to her work place and drag her out and that today we will see who he really is. I'm currently in my car couple blocks to where I live and I'm scared I don't know what to do. This isn't the first time he blows up but I just can't keep it. He keeps threatening my mom since we got our greencard from him and we want to stay here ( they've been married for almost 5 years). I'm afraid to escalate but how am I supposed to sleep knowing he is living in the same place as us?    How can I protect my mom's and I's status? He keeps saying he will say the marriage was a sham (it wasn't). How hard is it to win if he does this (we do have photo evidence and many people that can probably testify).   I'm sorry This is probably not the right place to have a meltdown but I can't keep pretending this isn't happening. I know this will make it way harder for us financially(if he leaves) but at least we can sleep fine	Yes
6	So I was recently jailed on an Domestic Assault charge on a person that I've been friends with for years. The only reason it was classified as Domestic Assault is because we dated years ago. I'm really shaken about the entire court process and I plead not guilty. However I have numerous scratches and contussions from the actual fight, but I was the person that was taken to jail. With a no contact order in place she is on Facebook taking about she beat me up and knew I would to go to jail, she also messaged me an apology and said have a nice life. Her family was there when all this happened and I didn't have any witnesses of my own.  Is this case going to stand up in court or do I need to get an attorney? I also want to get a teaching license and would rather not have anything violent on my background. If you guys could help me out I would definitely appreciate it.	Yes
7	Greetings everyone.  I am having a hellish time trying to move on / away from my abusive ex fiance of 4 years. It's a complicated situation and it invovles a lot of manipulation, lies, defamation and abuse on her part that I would like to put a stop to, but need help doing so since my own efforts to disuade her have not worked out. I'm in colorado. If you know of any good lawyers that care about mens rights please help me find them because I am afraid being the male and her acting like a victim all the time when I never do anything but raise my voice and demand her to take responsibility for her actions!	Yes
8	I don't want him to go to jail. I didn't think it would result in criminal charges.	Yes
9	I have recently gone through a really bad breakup and me and my family are being harassed by my ex. She calls from a blocked number, she somehow sees what I post on instagram even though she is blocked and I'm sure she doesn't have a fake account to follow me because I am on private and know who each follower is. I would just change my number but it goes beyond calls.   I don't want to have to do it because her family is cool and her dad works in the prison system but I really don't have a choice. She has physically hit me on multiple occasions, the night we broke up she ripped my shirt off and threw a cup at my head, she once started yelling loudly that I was physically hurting her and to stop hurting her even though we were just arguing (I called my mom and told her what she was doing in case she called the cops and I was arrested), it's just a total nightmare. She is diagnosed bipolar and has been 5150'd. When she was 5150'd I let them know she had been physical otherwise they wouldn't have take her.   Do I need to put all my family on the request for protection? Can I fill out the domestic violence one if I don't have proof of the violence? Also this seems like it should be the last of my worries but I have no time I can use to take off work because I've used it all from all the stress that has caused. Will the court let me request a specific date so I can not miss work?  Any help is appreciated. I can go a week with no calls and then once they start I get so anxious and sick to my stomach. I'm already in treatment for depression and anxiety and her contacting me is the only thing that causes it to flair up.	Yes
10	I am a resident of Virginia and am being harassed by my abusive ex who lives in Indiana. When our relationship ended four years ago, I was granted a no contact order and a temporary restraining order; I left the state shortly after and thought that was the end of it. He has recently begun harassing me again via phone calls and texts from various numbers. I have changed my number twice and he managed to get the new number both times. Is there any legal recourse from a different state?	Yes
11	Hello all. I've been putting off posting this for some time as I fear the social backlash it will likely cause against me, deservedly so.  I have been charged with a DUI and wonton endangerment. This is my first offense with no prior of any wrong doing of any kind on my record, aside from a couple speeding tickets years before. I will share this short story that I believe contributes to my case, but I suspect it will not be relevant to those who make the ultimate decisions:  I was in a physically abusive relationship and couldn't hold a stable job; unable to find work in my field I was a miscellaneous contractor for a couple different positions that I was thoroughly unsatisfied with. I honestly thought I was only a drag to my partner, not worth anything, and unable to contribute to the household; because I couldn't.  Rewind to end of last year: two days prior to my offense, my partner finally hit me hard enough for me to call the police. He went to jail that night which was not my intention at all. I was expecting the police to show up, see me, give him a stern talking to, and leave. Instead, they saw my face and took him to jail.  So, now, I sat in an empty apartment realizing the severe trouble I just caused. I couldn't possibly have made his life any worse at this point. Two days go by I am alone still having heard no word from him at all. Unware of if he was still in jail or what was happening. I didn't want him to be in jail. It was never my intention to make his life worse than I already had.  He finally texts me the night of the incident and that's when I made the poor decision to go pick him up. The worst mistake of my life.  I thank whatever supernatural power you may believe in that I did not kill anybody. I struck three vehicles, none of which caused any serious injury and my insurance company has taken care of them well. I was petrified I may have hurt people trying to rescue the situation I caused with my partner by attempting to pick him up.  I did not press charges against my partner for abuse because I still believe I pushed him to the point of physical violence with my stupidity and inability to contribute to the household.  Since then, on the brighter side of the fence, I am on home incarceration and finally have a very stable job at a very respectable company in the field I love. This job started at the beginning of the year; I got it within a week of having a work release in HIP and in the short time I've been here I have already been promoted.  My lawyer and I talk very little but I'm hearing this is pretty common. I just received a release to visit his office and speak with him. The little I have gathered (and this was only a couple weeks ago) is that the prosecutor wants 7 years of hard prison time.  With as little as I have talked with him, he doesn't sound very confident in the ability to change that. From what I have gathered at my hearings, that is an offer made by the prosecutor but my lawyer has not yet approached me with it.  Is there anything I should be bringing to his attention of the situation? Is there anything I should be pushing for?  Ultimately, I just want to prove that I am still a capable human being and would love to resume being a good, tax paying citizen. I've worked my butt off the past 3 months in an effort to show the world the one mistake I made under duress was a one-time thing, but I suspect it will all be for naught very soon.	Yes
12	"Ok, so I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I recently found out that an ex of mine had called the police on me multiple times during our relationship and after it. He had claimed I was stalking him. I don't know how he convinced the police not to speak to me, or maybe he gave them my incorrect information, who knows.. But I never spoke to an officer. I only found out, well, I found out the first bit one day when I looked at his phone and saw him repeat dialing this number. When I called it, it was a sargents number. I woke him up and confronted him about it. That's when I found out he had called the police on me for accidentally breaking his window. He never set his buzzer up on his apartment, and when I'd come over, since he didn't want me to yell, I'd have to throw something at his window to get his attention to let him know I was there. One time it cracked the very edge of the glass, a tiny hairline fracture. (If I were intentionally breaking his window, I'd probably throw a brick through it, not my set of keys like I always did). Mind you, when he called the police he was texting wiith me saying he wanted to move in with me, etc... And he had called the woman he was cheating on me with.. right before calling the police (lol). Anyway, much later, I come to find out he called and made stalking claims against me when I'd be somehwere he was and I'd almost bust him cheating.. He'd then like.. stop communicating with the police about it, so it would never go anywhere. Anyway, I have printed off the proof that he's full of crap, he told me to do everything he subsquently called the police on me for, and that while telling the police I was ""stalking him and harasassing him"".. he was actually stalking and harassing me because I didn't want to be with him and he wouldn't stop bothering me. I mean, he messaged me on valentines day and I didn't read it for two weeks.. And I find out, recently, in that two weeks in took me to respond he was on here posting about how he ""just wants to be left alone"" and how I ""won't stop stalking him"".. He got meaner and meaner the further time went on and I didn't answer. Crazy ass behavior. Anyway.. is there a law against this? There freaking has to be?"	Yes
13	(I'm going to apologize for this wall of text, but I really need to get this out there. We need help ,and I can't find anywhere else on reddit to ask these questions.)  I'm in need of some serious help here. I'm 23 and out of the house, but I have sisters back at home. We were all adopted. To give you some back story: I have 2 other sisters, 17 and 18. They live in NJ while I'm in Ohio. Yesterday they visited and while we were alone, my 18 year old sister said she needed to speak with me. Long story short, she had confirmed my long-term suspicion: my father is a creep, and is sexually harassing her, to put it lightly. I've been *slightly* suspicious for a while now, after he made some off-handed remarks to me and a couple incidents of inappropriate touching. I gave him the benefit of the doubt with the touching; I always just assumed it was an accident when it happened. It turns out that he had been making the very same comments to her, only it and the touching has gotten more extreme to the point where she is petrified of being alone with him in the house.   That being said, my obvious first reaction is to get her out of the house. I have an apartment with my SO and we are both willing to have her here. Getting her here isn't too much of an issue. We do have a problem though: her bank account. I don't remember the details, but she said that the *only* way she is able to withdraw money is with our parents present until she's 21. We're afraid that, since dad has control over the account, he will withdraw all of her money. Yes, he would do that to her. Is there any way around that policy? Can we talk to the bank and explain the situation and can they make an exception based off that? Also, since she is 18, there obviously isn't a problem with where she goes. But like I said before, my other sister is 17. If I got her out of the house and dad got angry, could I be arrested for kidnapping? I just want all my bases covered.   And here's a second thing: what do we do about HIM? My sister has done what she can, I think. She has contacted the police on a few ocassions. They brought him in for questioning, but nothing came of it. The problem is that our father uses his clout of being an ex-police officer of 20 years to get him by in this situation. It doesn't help that my sister has had a habit of over reactions and exaggerations (this is obviously not one of them). It seems that local law enforcement will do nothing major for her now. There's also the fact that she's tried to bring this up to our mother. As I said in the title, no one, not even our mother, believes her. Dad is smart, and always makes sure that his creepiness can be masked to look like something completely innocent. Understandably, mom has always given him the benefit of the doubt (along with everyone else), despite warning signs that even she is aware of (ex: dad sometimes watches things like documentaries of crimes of women being raped (seriously dad, what the fuck). Mom tells him repeatedly to turn those things off. She doesn't seem to put 2 and 2 together). That being said...what the hell am I supposed to do about this? Is there nothing that can be done? Will he never be punished for this?  This is how it's starting to look to me, and I can't believe it.   If anyone has any answers, or even just advice, please tell me. I'm coming to my wit's end.	Yes
14	My boyfriend moved out about a month ago while I was staying with family. Some of the things he moved out were mine, things I paid for and never intended to gift him. Things like my mattress, Keurig, tv stand, sound bar, personal care and cleaning items, groceries, and art supplies. Pretty much anything he wanted that was mine, he took.  In May, he needed money to have his car fixed and I loaned him $5,000. I had him sign a basic contract stating this.  After he moved out and I realized he took my things, I contacted him about returning them. He's claiming he will pay me back for the items along with the loan. I admittedly called and texted him multiple times trying to get him to commit to returning my stuff.   This morning, I received an email that a hearing has been set for a protective order he filed against me. There isn't a protective order in place yet but it could happen. The only evidence he has against me is threatening to have him arrested for stealing my things and asking him to return my stuff. I definitely blew up his phone a couple times but I was trying to get my stuff and panicking about bills.  He always responded to my calls and texts and even texted and called me unprovoked a couple times over the last couple weeks. I want to fight the protective order but don't know how the hearing will go. My ex is currently on probation for a domestic battery against his last girlfriend but I don't know if that will matter.   We're also on a lease together but from what I've heard, I'm pretty much going to have to eat his half of the rent, utilities, etc.   What do I do? How do I go about preparing for the protective order hearing? I don't want to not be able to contact him because I want him to return my stuff. Should I take the $5,000 loan to small claims? He really screwed me over and I feel like he keeps finding ways of avoiding his obligations. Thanks in advance for any advice, I really appreciate it.	Yes
15	(Portland, OR) My transgender partner and I got into an argument. The argument continued to escalate to the point where I made a really horrible comment invalidating her gender. In response to this, she lunged at me and started punching me, pulling me down to the ground and beating me with a broomstick. I managed to constrain her and make my way out of the apartment. I called 911 and they arrested her.  When the police arrived, I made the mistake of talking to police who recorded a statement (I was completely jostled and nearly out of it when he was asking me questions). My apartment management also convinced me to call the DA and give them the case number. I have not yet been contacted by a prosecutor.  I do not wish to follow through with prosecution. While in this one instance she initiated the attack, I believe there has been a mutual pattern of abuse in our relationship. There have been times when I have yelled at her or made physical contact (such as grabbing her and trying to force her out of the room or pushing her when she was in my face). Usually this happens after we have been arguing and it quickly devolves into shouting matches. We are both to blame for raising our voices, talking over one another and escalating these arguments. We both say horrible things to one another. It's just a mutually abusive relationship that I want both of us to be out of because we've tried it for so long and it does neither of us any good.   tldr; me and transgender girlfriend got in fight, she was arrested for domestic assault, I called DA with case number. What can I do to have them drop charges / not continue with case?	Yes
16	"The title is self explanatory. My ex boyfriend's pre-trial court date is tomorrow regarding violating the order of protection I have. In CT that is a class D felony. I checked online and during his last court date he plead ""not guilty"", so I'm assuming tomorrow the judge either decides if he is found guilty or not. If he is found guilty, is there another date scheduled in the future for sentencing?  I know nobody can 100% predict what the judge will decide, but what are the chances he receives jail time? He was arrested for harassment in the 2nd degree (class C misdemeanor),  conspiracy to harass (class C misdemeanor), and stalking in the 2nd degree (class A misdemeanor). Since it was his first offense, he was allowed to join the Family Violence program and take some counseling. But, during that time he broke the no-contact protective order the court gave me.   I'm really worried if he receives jail time he will try to harm me. I know his family and him own weapons, but I obviously have no proof to show the court. During his court date tomorrow I have to take an exam and there is no way I can change the date. I'm so worried about leaving my baby sister and family alone in the house in case he comes to my house after. I'm not sure if I'm just thinking irrationally because of fear. I already have bad anxiety and OCD, so my thoughts are a mess right now. I keep on having a tick where I'm imagining him hurting my family and I can't get it out of my head no matter how much I try to fight it. I'm really unsure of what to do. Any help is appreciated."	Yes
17	I'm a victim in a domestic violence case. Ex boyfriend punched me in 2013, so an order of protection was placed. He contacted me a few months later via phone. He did 90 days for the assault and criminal contempt 2nd in 2014. 2015 he violated again for calling me and being at my house. He got 1-3 Yrs upstate for aggravated family offense and criminal contempt 1st. He got out on parole last year and is currently still on it. He violated by calling me again in April. This time they charged him with a misdemeanor and RORed him. How is that possible ? He's already had 3 court dates and RORed each one. No d.a contacted me until today, the day before his next court date and told me its because he wasn't in my house this time ? I have a full stay away it doesn't make sense and isk what to do. He's never going to stop :-( help ...btw I have the entire call log as well as texts from that day but I didn't mention the texts in the initial police report.	Yes
18	So this is a bit of a shit storm my  gf got me into. As stated above we got into an argument and the cops were called. my gf is an alcoholic, and started to tell the cops about how i hit her in the past even though these were very false allegations. now i wasn't talked to or even approached by the police. she signed a waiver stating she didn't want to have me arrested. we received a letter in the mail yesterday from the local police dept trying to get her to contact a detective to gather evidence against me to get a warrant for a crime i didn't commit. she said she would call them and let them know she didn't want to press charges or anything against me. should i lawyer up? can a case be built against me if i wasn't even talked to that night and my gf doesn't want to pursue it?	Yes
19	currently in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, I'm working on getting out (all without his knowledge) I'm just trying to tie up loose ends. A few months ago I fell asleep in one of the recliners in our living room and when I woke up he had his phone out and showed me ALOT of pictures he took of me with his penis out and on my face in various different places. near and almost in my mouth from what I can remember. he only showed them to me that one time then refused to delete them when I begged him to. be he wouldn't even show them to me again when I asked. he laughed and thought it was funny and never showed them to me again. I feel so violated. what can I do? press charges? ensure somehow they get deleted??	Yes
20	She has a psychiatrist, therapist, and will be taken to a mental hospital soon. She wants to know if she can be required to give the name/s of her rapist and if she can be punished for not doing so. She lives in Ohio.	Yes
21	My stbxMIL is suing me, she already sued me for something else and won (mostly because it was considered a martial contract that was violated) but has since agreed to drop it in exchange for me relinquishing my half of ownership on the cars. This suit is for a bunch of stuff, most of it is money she gave to him for various things before we got married and the money never went through my hands. There was one thing that we were married for but there was no agreement attached to it like her first suit and a couple of other things that I probably won't be able to get out of. She is also pursuing almost $1,000 for emotional trauma. Earlier this year she kicked me out, pushed me to my limits and ended up calling the police and filing a protective order. I want to countersue for emotional damages but I'm not sure for how much and all of that. It is small claims. Any advice is much appreciated	Yes
22	The title says it all. My sister's probation officer is as negligible as a law enforcement professional can be.   A bit of a back story on how my sister ended up on probation is needed. My sister at 7 months pregnant decided to drive heavily intoxicated with my 2 nieces. She was arrested, charged with 3 counts of child abuse/endangerment and a DUI. Even after being released from a short stay in jail and giving birth to my nephew, she continued to drink. Her PO gave her an option - 3 months mandatory in rehab or 3 months in jail. She decided to go to rehab and things were going pretty well.   Fast forward to today and she has not done any of her mandatory parenting classes or DUI classes and she is continuing to do drugs and drink. And this is not my opinion. If you took one look at my sister, you would know. Her behavior has caused my nephews and nieces assigned social worker to contact her PO and tell him that he needs to take a closer look at what is going on.   To top it all off, she has committed fraud 2 times already. First time she stole a check from a mailbox, went to a cash checking place and cashed it. The business found out what went on and filed a police report. Just today my dad's accountant made him aware of 3 stolen personal checks that my sister cashed. My dad filed a report with police but they stated that they can issue a warrant because it's hear say even though my dad had images of the stolen checks.   My parents called the PO and let him know they are extremely worried about her and his response was that he is aware of what is going on and that  he's going to give her a week to get it together! It's a joke. My parents response was that she could be dead in a week with how fast she is spiraling out of control. Yet she goes to probation today and nothing happens.   Somehow she has managed to pull one over this guy and it's sickening how oblivious to everything this guy is. He is completely negligent. She has somehow passed her drug/alcohol tests for probation (which are scheduled by the way and only a mouth swab) but she has not done any of her mandatory random drug tests for social services because they are random urine tests that she will fail.   My family and I want to file a grievance because the man is not doing his job. To be honest, I think he's sleeping with her. He doesn't know where she lives and she is lying about having a job. It's mind boggling. What do I do? I'm in Orange county, California.	Yes
23	Family law cases, including domestic violence and child custody, represent the largest category of cases closed by LSC grantees each year. Millions of women, men, and children experience domestic violence in the U.S. every year. Legal aid is essential to protect domestic violence victims and their families and to help them overcome many associated problems that can endanger their safety and stability.   In 2016 LSC grantees closed 115,977 domestic violence cases involving nearly 282,014 victims and their families. This represents nearly 16% of all cases closed by grantees nationwide.  Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. On average, nearly **20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States.** During one year, this equates to more than 10 million individuals.   Often survivors face additional legal problems. Ninety-seven percent of low-income households with survivors of recent domestic violence or sexual assault experienced at least one other civil legal problem in the past year, including 67% that have experienced 6+ problems.   A study by the Institute for Policy Integrity found that civil legal aid is more effective than access to shelters or counseling services in reducing domestic violence—by as much as 21%. Increasing a woman’s chances of obtaining a protective order is the most effective way that legal assistance can reduce domestic violence. Survivors of domestic violence rate the filing of a protective order as one of their two most effective tools for stopping domestic violence, second only to leaving the abuser. Representation is critical in these cases as **83% of victims represented by an attorney successfully obtained a protective order, compared to only 32% of victims without an attorney.**  LSC grantees help clients [provide safe, stable environments for their children](http://www.lsc.gov/legal-aid-helps-domestic-violence-survivor-save-her-home), [build violence-free lives](http://www.lsc.gov/protecting-mother-six-domestic-violence-alaska), and [reunite with their families](http://www.lsc.gov/helping-father-reunite-his-children).

24	My mom has been living with her ex-boyfriend for about 6 months. After coming back from the oil rig one week, he broke her arm into half and sent her to the hospital. Now, after posting bail he's changed the locks on the house and has barricaded the driveway with his spare truck while he goes back on the rig. She just wants to collect her and my sisters belongings so they can move on with their lives, is there any legal method of doing this?	Yes
25	I'm in desperate need of some help.  I am a 19 year old male who lives in Australia and I'm in a really bad situation and I don't know what to do.  2 weeks ago my girlfriend came over to my place to hang out for the night. Everything started off ok and I became pretty drunk after a few hours and I remember she helped me into the bedroom. Then all I really remember is waking up to find her on top of me with my arms tied to the headboard. I shoved her off and asked her what the fuck she was doing. That's when she told me if I tell anyone she will report me for raping her.  I don't know what to do, I feel disgusting I feel ashamed I have become so severely depressed I don't want to live anymore.  I want to report, I badly want to report her. But I know she will say I did it.  What do I do?	Yes
26	"A few days ago, my dad received a letter from some legal advice company (not an official court summons) that said that they could help with his case of domestic violence and a restraining order against him. We looked up the case number included in the letter, and it indeed did have his name on it, and that he's being sued for domestic violence by some woman that he claims he's never met. I do believe my father 100%, since he's never raised a hand against my mother or my siblings and I for as long as I can remember. (Though I am open to the possibility that he may be lying, but I really doubt that.)  We're not sure if this is a real fraudulent case against my father, or if this is a mistake that this legal advice company made. What we do know is that there's a court hearing a few weeks from now and that this was filed in the city that we live in. As of now, we don't have any official documents from the court letting him know that he's being sued. My hope is that this is all a huge misunderstanding.   Main thing that worries us is that my dad has just started the naturalization process to become a US citizen, and that this ""lawsuit"" could have a negative impact on that.   Regardless, we are going down to the courthouse later this week to make sure."	Yes
27	My soon to be ex husband came over and took my tv. (Were separated) I said no and was blocking the tv. He kicked me in the stomach and punched me in the arm to shove me away and grabbed the tv. I grabbed his shirt as he was leaving and it tore. He said great now when you call the cops it will look like you attacked me and you'll be arrested. He did this all in front of our 3 yr old son. What can I do? If anything. I didn't touch him (besides grabbing his shirt).	Yes
28	So some of you may remember my posts. I'm obv not the best writer so I'll try harder here to make it soft on the eyes. This is a long read but quite interesting. Anyone who can help you may be saving a life. I have no where else to turn and I am miserable ridden with pain and anxiety. Here we go.  My ex was a controlling abuser. Emotionally physically and now sexually she abused me. I was young dumb and in love. When we broke up she was flirting with my step brother heavily, this angered me and I had screen shots of the messaged (she left her insta logged in my phone) and I threatened to show her parents what kinda person she is. She then got a RO against me for the reason of me telling her parents. She lied in the entire thing. Making up abuse and criminal charges against me. i.e. She said I was charged with assault 2 never happened. She said I am a felon( I was a felon about a year ago got in reduced per plea deal, the felony was for selling 2 grams of weed to a friend when I was 18. I live in Oregon too, fuck me right?) anyways the order got granted I tried to fight it, i fucked up and missed court. So I am Unable to fight it.   Before she got the order she mentioned she was going to, so I start to compile evidence, I have so much on her. She would blackmail me with self harm daily, I have a picture where she carved my name into her leg with a knife. I mean it she messed me up with all these games. I find in my google drive a video taken from my phone by her, of her touching me and riding me from a POV style. I am dead asleep obviously in the video. This is rape. This is sexual assault. This isn't the first time She would do this. We would fight and she would try and force sex on to me to make me feel better. I would literally have to fight her off. Cuz I obv didn't want it.   I realize I want to wait till after the restraining order blows over to report the crime. Since it is over due to my incompetence, i feel as if it's a good time to report. I report earlier today to the local PD. No lawyer. No counsel. Just you guys. He says he is going to investigate her for invasion of privacy. I think to my self that this is just the start, and when detectives see the video, they will drop the hammer. The policeman doesn't even wanna see it. He just takes my word and calls her. After his talk with her he's dismissing the case. I swear he probably told her what to say. She even admitted in the video it's her. And when I found the video initially before the RO was served I confronted her about it. I asked why did she have sex with me with no consent you know that's rape right? Or something along the lines. She said I woke up during the video. So it was fine. Which is a lie. The officer told me she said we filmed many of our sexual encounters (not many but some) and we would wake up daily at 2 am to have sex. (Another lie) I was bringing all the money in I needed my sleep.   Another bone in this is that someone is messaging her off a private instagram, telling her that I'm Spreading nude photos of her. (Complete lie and not me doing this I'm not gonna risk violating my RO) I feel it's another ex BF one whom she claimed raped her (she lied about it she went to his house and fucked him a week later while dating me :( ) and he's kinda getting some revenge on her for this. I'm very scared I'm gonna get framed for something I didn't do, I swear the cop was more concerned about this instagram ghost then he was about me. He didn't care to watch my clips, and he hung up on me mid sentence.   I'm shocked everyone. I'm in awe. I have to take Xanax (prescribed) to just sleep. The betrayal is more then I can handle. I'm calling a lawyer Monday morning and seeing what he says. In the meantime any idea from you all? I called just the local PD but I feel the sheriffs will take this much more seriously. After pleading with the officer that I'm a victim and this is rape since it's sex with no consent. He said I shoulda woke up and wasn't on anything. He was just bullshitting me the whole time. From what I remember he said he would leave the case open, and have a detective check it out. Thank god. My light isn't done yet. I wanna get a lawyer asap I am Just low in cash. And since I know I'm not Messaging her, spreading her nudes, or getting anyone else to messaged her, I won't be in trouble I hope. But you never know.   She also says she has some voice recordings from When I found out she was flirting hard with my step bro. I was furious. All I said was that I was gonna ruin her life by telling her parents yadadada I was really angry. Never made threats of violence at all or anything really illegal. Just a little annoyance.   So guys what do I do? Be worried about this instagram ghost? Get a good lawyer? Or get legal aid? Very confused ,scared and alone. The cop treated me like a fucking joke. If the genders were reversed here I'd be rotting in jail as I type this. Any and all comments welcome. I love you all truly. This is a very hard time in my life, and if I don't find the strength I will fall.   PS: if I post something about her, not sexual or anything, on my fb, is that gonna get me in trouble? I really wanna post the pic of my name on her leg. Let everyone see how crazy she is.	Yes
29	My girlfriend and I live together and share a lease in an apartment. I believe I am the primary signature on the lease.   A few days ago my girlfriend and I were arguing, an argument which continued as we entered the bedroom. We were both in bed and I was facing away from her in an attempt to fall asleep, the lights were off and I was trying to end the conflict. The argument was continuing, and I wasn't helping things by telling her to shut up. She eventually started hitting me, which unfortunately has happened before and I told her don't hit me. She hit me again and I turned around in the dark and struck her back, in the chest.   Her immediate response was too cry out and jump from bed, saying she was calling the cops. It all happened very quickly. I got out of bed and got dressed, and waited for the police who arrived extremely quickly. I was fairly shocked at the speed of all this. The police questioned me, and I cooperated fully, explaining to them what I am typing to you now.   At the time I was in a daze. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. I struck my girlfriend out of frustration of her always hitting me. At the time I just wanted her to realize it wasn't fair what she was doing. I know there's no such thing as an excuse especially not in this situation.   Anyways the police cuffed me and took me to jail which I cooperated fully with. I am now being charged with assault. As a stipulation to being released, I was asked to sign a notice to appear, and to agree to fully cut off contact with my (now former) girlfriend. Finally I am not to return to my apartment, where I live and keep all my possessions.   I understand from the information that the police have given me that my ex girlfriend is leaving the apartment. She has a new place to live in the start of August. This means she will be able to start out again on her own, which I am fine with. I really do wish her the best and I look at this incident with sadness and regret.   But now I am under police order to not return to my apartment. Even in a week, once my ex moves out, I am apparently still not to return.   I need advice for, once my apartment has been vacated by my ex, how to regain access to my life and apartment.   I have a court date but it isn't until the 22nd of August. I am staying at a friend's but this whole debacle is weighing heavily on my conscience. I am almost positive that there are no injuries involved. I really hope now that my girlfriend still has compassion for me which I assume she does. I realize my mistake, especially during the moment when I justified my actions as self defense.   But now I am on charges without access to my apartment. Is there something I can do? I plan to, if the charges are not dropped before the 22nd, to lawyer up. I just need some advice about my position.   I am not going to contact my girlfriend because it's part of my release agreement. I just need to get my life back as soon as possible.   Please help!	Yes
30	So my sisters husband that tried killing him self confessed in a phone call to his friend that the reason he tried killing himself is because he molested my nephew at age 5 (he's now 15) but my nephew does not remember and does not want to make a statement ... but also in this phone call he he confessed to it being 4 children all together and this was the unmonitored phone call they give u before u r admitted ... I'm wondering how the investigation process for that works and if someone could give me legal advice for direction on getting him prosecuted	Yes
31	This is a throwaway account to protect our identities as much as possible but this does take place in the state of California. So a few months ago, my twin sister was raped after our high school graduation party. She's not in a good state of mind right now and is extremely angry at me because I was actually their target. I don't blame her in the slightest because the group of boys said my name a few times during the ordeal.  My grandparents and parents are both extremely traditional people. They hold strong to their traditional Asian values of practically blind worship to the senior generation. My grandparents were extremely against the idea of abortion while my parents were on the fence but leaning towards my grandparents because of that respect towards the elder generation. Eventually, my grandfather found out that I was coordinating with my sister's best friend on how to get my sister to an abortion clinic. That night my grandfather kidnapped my sister and they were missing for almost a month before the police found them. My grandfather was trying to fly her to China.  During that month, we discovered the identities of the rapists and we also have the semen samples from the rape kit as further evidence. I got in a rather heated exchange with several of the perpetrators but now I'm being threatened with both my and my sister's integrity. They realize that we can easily ruin their lives forever and send them to jail which is why they are threatening to release a video of the entire rape to the student body of the university that we will be attending after the summer. The group of boys dragged me into a room and molested me while forcing me to watch the video. I was forced to give one of them oral sex in order to keep them quiet about the video. I tried to keep a semen sample but they took it away. They didn't penetrate me and my hymen is still intact so I don't have any evidence to prove this happened the way that it did. They did video me doing everything and I was forced to say it was consensual. I'm sad I had to do this but I want to help my sister however much I can even if it's just to shut this group of boys up so that event isn't revealed.  The entire incident has been kept very quiet because my parents insist that our momentary desire for vengeance is much less important than the stigma such an incident will cause if it becomes public. My sister hasn't said a single word and I'm very worried about her. She isn't mentally stable right now and while so far not suicidal, I am very worried. My grandfather has since returned but now after realizing that there is a high possibility of the father being black, he is insisting that she abort the baby. We just got back from the abortion clinic a few hours ago but they are refusing to help because my sister won't reply to anything that they say and that she isn't mentally sound.  I don't know what to do and don't know who to talk to. My family wants to keep everything quiet. My sister has not said a single thing. She did yell at me for a few minutes but quickly stopped talking. It's been over a month since I last heard her voice. I don't know what to do! I should be an adult right? I'm already 18 but I don't feel like an adult. This whole thing feels like a guillotine hanging over our necks.  How can I report those boys to the police without everything becoming public? They already said that if we take them down then they will take us down with them. One of them said he will help me if I have sex with him but I don't want to.  What should I do about my family? Right now they are against everything that I think should be done and my sister has not replied to anything that we ask.  I'm so angry! My grandfather kidnapped my sister causing everything to be delayed so long and now he has completely changed his point of view. First he was trying everything to prevent the abortion and now he is trying everything to force her into it. He even threatened me while holding a coat hanger because I pushed him away when he was trying to enter my sister's room. I also can't stop crying every time I hear my mom and dad regret having daughters.  The reason I'm posting here is because I was hoping a lawyer could give me advice on what to do. I feel really alone right now. The group of rapists is threatening me from the front while my family isn't doing anything to help from the back. My sister is completely silent and I'm worried about her committing suicide even though she hasn't shown any intent to.  Am I even in the right place? Can a lawyer even help me? I want to sue my family and get protective custody of my sister but can I even do this? My sister hasn't said a single word and has no response to anything that anyone asks. All she does is sit there. The only person who knows other than the related parties is my sister's best friend. Not even my best friend knows.  Please help me. I don't care if my video goes public. I only want to prevent my sister's video from becoming public. The problem is that we are identical twins so either video becoming public would be bad for my sister. I tried fighting back against the group of boys but they responded by posting a short clip of my sister's video to this website and everybody on that website is showing crazy enthusiasm for it. I tried to use that to my advantage but nobody on that website has an account only a bunch of numbers where their name should be. I've bookmarked the link to that website but I don't even want to look at it anymore because I cry every time I read the replies.  I don't even know if I can ask a lawyer to help me. My family obviously won't pay for it and I only have a few thousand dollars.I read online that there are lawyers who might do this for free but how do I find them?	Yes
32	I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday.   So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably.   She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony.   Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers.   That sparked a heated argument.   Long story short;   *Sshe got in the car with her kids  * I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers   * She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety  * I stand in front of the car as I call the police  * She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way  * I jumped on the hood  * She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably   * She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me  * Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures    .................  This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed.   Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?  What charges can I have against her?  I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.	Yes
33	My wife got a new fulltime job recently but still is in the probation period. Shes been put on bed rest for few months for reasons. Her work isn't office work so she can't do it from home or anything. Can she get fired? Does she have legal protection against being fired?	Yes
34	Some context.  My father and mother split apart five years ago.  I occasionally keep in touch with my father.    My father got arrested last weekend for domestic abuse.  Now I don't know the whole situation but I don't condone domestic violence.  My father spent the weekend in jail, and bailed himself out.  In the meantime his girlfriend took a restraining order out on him so he cannot return to the house to get his belongings.  He has personal artifacts (items he had long before he met this other woman), some jewelry (again he had long before he met this other woman), and his passport.    I want to know what my father can do to retrieve his rightful items.    P.S. My father and the girlfriend just bought the house he has been exiled from.  I would also like to know if this could be taken away from him or what his rights are.	Yes
35	As the title says I was pulled over for speeding and found that my license had been suspended due to an unpaid ticket, which I thought I had paid. It had been suspended for quite a while, over a year. I've paid my fines and gotten my license reinstate. Colorado laws says I have to have knowledge of the suspension but I'm not sure how I can prove I was unaware. I can't afford an attorney. I can bring bank records to show I used Uber to get to work from the time I was suspended until it was reinstated. I remember receiving notices in the mail about the ticket but got nothing saying I was suspended, when spoke with the credit agency holding the account for my unpaid ticket they had an incorrect address for me, should I mention this? Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know what to do or what to expect. My court date is Thursday. Thank you ahead of time for any advice or encouragement.	Yes
36	Someone I know had their daughter falsely accuse them of sexual abuse. She said to her mom that she was just trying to relate with her friend because her friend was talking about being abused. Her friend told the counselor at school, the girl freaked out and stuck to the story of molestation because she was scared. she was not expecting the situation to blow out of proportion. My friend's daughter is 12, she wants to fix this, what can she do?	Yes
37	I met my girlfriend in high school and we've been together for about a year now. Before she dated me she dated somebody else who had problems. They broke up because he physically abused her and cheated on her.  A while back, I want to say about four or five months ago, he began stalking her. Circumstance had it set that while they were dating, he activated some kind of software on her phone and was able to completely bug her. Anyone's voice or location could be visible/audible when in the vicinity of this phone. He used it to track her down and try god-knows-what. He hit her one time while I was at work. There was a police report and all this and that, and an emergency restraining order.   This is really only the spark-notes of it. There was a lot more going on. A lot of nights I went without sleep and jumping at every creek and bump in the night. Since then, however, (As far as we know) this bug as been disabled and we got her a new phone for the time being.  Recently, this phone broke and, after wiping her old phone clean (New iCloud account, all this Apple jargon that I can't decipher being an android man) she switched back to it. We're planning on moving here soon so getting these luxuries aren't primarily on our minds.  Now, since having been switched back to Phone A, this stalking continues. She lives with me now and we're planning to move out of state, so I feel like I have a better grasp on her safety. Still, these texts come and go of this stalker begging to see her, come drop off old memorabilia, just one last talk, etc etc. Through chance(?) he's ran into her while running errands, and threats of macing out of self defense were thrown around. He often texts me trying to get under my skin, but beyond that he's afraid of me and rightly so. My blood is boiling typing this out. Again the long nights of no sleep and investigating every minor sound and dog bark continue. I feel like I'm driving myself nuts. I always keep an ear out for any movement, vibration, whatever in this house. Thankfully she stays with good friends or my mother while I'm at work.  I'm scared and angry. What do we do?  Throwaway, because hey. This stalker scrambles for our social media at every chance.	Yes
38	Mom and i recently found out my father (divored) has been molesting my sisters but they hid it for years because they didnt want to lose their dad. We tried to report him but they sent cops and cps to our mom trying to charge her for it  because there's no proof against him. Also, my sisters said they found child porn on his phone but they didnt mention it to cops because they were telling them theyll go to a foster home.  How can we report him for that instead? My sisters dont see him no more	Yes
39	My ex has filed a domestic violence protection act against me, asserting that I had yelled at her, but nothing further than that in the instant.  While I did yell at her for one sentence in the midst of her yelling at me, this seems rather arbitrary and there was no assertion of violence (and never has there been in the past).  I have only contacted her since to apologize for yelling and to arrange a time for her to come and get her things.  More importantly she also asserted in this that previously I had made her leave the residence which we were staying (for which I was the only one on the lease and the only one paying rent) and she had no where to go during this time.  I can document that this is not true, that I only asked her to leave for one night and that she had her own separate residence to stay in.  Also that I had assaulted her by touching her sexually while she was sleeping and could not give consent (while we were dating and having consensual sex), which is also false but of course there is no way for me to prove this.  Are there any repercussions of this?	Yes
40	Recently my sister's friend confronted her ex, and father of her child, and he made claims about wanting to kill my sister, strangling his other children, and made a bunch of other threatening comments. Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney.   Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?	Yes
41	"A couple of weeks ago, my best friend was a victim of domestic battery by her boyfriend of two years. I have never liked him, but I will try to be as unbiased as I can.  Basically, she is trying to get a restraining order against him, and I don't think he can contact her. Now he's contacting me and another friend about all kinds of things. One minute he's saying that he has a voicemail of my best friend drunk claiming to ""murder him"" if he is still in contact with a coworker that he had a bit of an affair with during their relationship. He's claiming that he's going to take HER to court over that, claiming to spend all his money to lock her up ""for good"", but at the same time telling me that he loves her and only wants the best for her. That he named a ""star after her"" and doesn't want to ""give up"" on their relationship.  I screenshot some of this conversation, mostly about him trying to ""lock up"" my best friend, but I have no idea how to continue. He's been blowing up my phone with texts for the past 30 minutes. Should I keep all of these texts for evidence? Would it be useful at all? Should I block him, or let him keep sending these texts?"	Yes
42	A couple months back I subletted a room in my apartment after my roommate needed to move out. Both the original roommate and me are on the lease, which ends August 1st. Because of the short notice, I found someone on a facebook roommate search group (I will refer to him as FR for former roommate). I spoke to the landlord, who requested an application and background check from FR, which was given to him. I asked about writing up my own sublease, but was told not to worry about it, that the landlord would prefer to write one up himself. To my knowledge he never got around to writing up the sublease.   About three weeks back, FR told me he got a temporary job in another city and would need to leave that weekend. He said he would have the rent, but would likely look for a sublet for his sublet. A couple days later he found someone (who I will refer to as NR for new roommate), who started moving in the next day. I asked FR if he had been in contact with the landlord, which he said he had. I talked to the landlord, it turned out he had not. The landlord made it clear that the NR should not have moved in without his consent, but was willing to organize getting the application from him and work it out.  NR was oblivious to all this, but when told of the situation was quick to get all necessary documents to the landlord.   The day before rent was due I organized with FR to drop off rent. I learned from NR that FR had collected rent money from him and was planning to hand it to me, so that I could give it to the landlord. FR claimed to be busy, so we organized for the next day. FR kept pushing the time back for when he’d drop off rent; I offered to pick it up, but he rejected the offer. When the landlord showed up to pick up rent, I apologized that FR had not showed up yet, to which the landlord informed me that FR told him I would be covering the rent in full. We were confused, but figured it could be a miscommunication and scheduled for the next day. At that point, I learned from NR that he had been told that the rent had already been paid. FR did not show up the next day either.   It is about a week later, and FR has made multiple excuses and has not shown up at any time he has told us that he would to drop off rent. I have asked him to send it to me via an app, but he claims that he cannot deposit the money because it is in cash and he does not have a local bank. I learned from NR that FR took $160 more than the cost of rent and insisted he give it to him in cash. It is apparent from the multiple discrepancies that FR does not plan on paying rent or returning the money that NR gave him. Luckily NR, the landlord, and I have been in full cooperation with one another, and have text messages citing the discrepancies in what FR has told us. The landlord suggested NR go to the police to file a report for the money that was taken, but the police informed us they could not do anything and this would need to be settled in civil court.  My question is what can we do about this situation? What rights do FR, NR, the landlord, and I have? I don’t have much hope for myself having any legal footing in terms of my own rights in this situation. I realize as the leaseholder, I am responsible for full rent. Unfortunately I won’t have the funds to cover the full rent until the end of the month, and will likely need to cover this with the deposit. How severely will this affect my ability to rent apartments in the future? Does NR have a case for fraud in civil court? How can the landlord and I support him in this? Also, FR has left some things in the apartment, and has attempted to get them back. What are his rights in terms of the things left behind?	Yes
43	How long does a restraining order take to get filed? I am accused of cyberstalking and harassing via text message. Theoretically, if my ex girlfriend were to have decided to get a restraining order against me, how long would it take to file? Would the police knock on my door the next day? Would it take weeks? I'm in no accusation of domestic violence or stalking her physically. It's only following her on social media and texting her. How long?	Yes
44	A few years ago after my mother's divorce she found a boyfriend, things started out well enough but once he moved in it went over the edge. He physically abused myself, and emotionally and mentally everyone else in the household (Mother, Sister and I). They have since separated and gone their different ways. After the breakup however new details came to light as to his past. Apparently he had innapropiate contact with his children and with other children. This came to us as he had left an Ipod/IPhone when he moved out where he recorded conversations with a counselor at his children's school and a psychologist as he went through his divorce. He currently works as girls soccer coach at a middle school in Durham NC. Both my mother and I fear what he can do as he is a master manipulator. I want to bring this to light for his employer, but I want to get my ducks in a row, by finding the names of his children or ex-wife in Georgia. How would I go about finding this information? I know divorce records are publicly available but as I live across the country in Washington State I don't know if I'll be able to access them. Any advice is appreciated and I apologize for the text wall and any mistakes I may have made wether it be formatting or posting guidelines.	Yes
45	I have gone 6 days without sleeping. Having trouble even writing this. Help plzzz	Yes
46	My wife caught my 14 year old nephew molesting my 4 year old daughter last night. They were camping, and the kids were in a tent together.   They were naked and he was on top of her. My daughter said that he has been touching her, and that this is not the first time.   They are on their way to the children's hospital now. My wife said my daughter's labia is red, and that she says it hurts and hurts when she pees.   I am out of the damn country, on business.   I am curious to know what will potentially happen to my nephew. I want him to have consequences, but would prefer he get therapy or something.   I can't find much on a google search, it just looks like he will be charged with sexual assault and face a possibility of 10 years in jail.	Yes
47	"GF and I broke up. I confronted her about her affairs and told her I would report her [unrelated] illegal activity. She got an order of protection. She went out of her way to tell me in an email that her police report included that I ""shattered a light switch.""  I have a family court hearing coming up. This is what I plan to include in the memo. (I know you'll tell me to talk to a lawyer but I can't afford one and none of the free legal centers answered their phones today. And the public defender doesn't see my case until the day of.)   &gt;The evening of July 2 I confronted X about her affair while we were in the bedroom. I moved out of the bedroom into the living room. As I was passing through the doorway, walking away from X, I open-palm slapped the wall, and then sat down on the couch. The bottom edge of my right hand hit the top left corner of the light switch and broke the top left corner of the light switch. This left a superficial scar on the bottom edge of my hand. The top edge of the light switch is about two inches below my elbow. I didn't raise my hands and I didn't throw a punch."	Yes
48	Hi. I'm unsure what to do here. I'll try and make this brief (at work, sorry!).   My mother's boyfriend kicked my mother out of the home they've shared on Wednesday. My mother has many mental health issues (MDD and bipolar disorder). She will not be able to emotionally handle any interaction with him. So I've taken over.  I've moved her into my home and plan on getting the rest of her stuff on Saturday. This includes a washer and dryer. The issue is that the ex is claiming he is keeping it. My mother purchased this with her own money and has receipts. When I told him no, he said we will now need to give him $1,500 to repair his car that he let my mother occasionally drive. I said no.   I wouldn't put it past him to damage the washer and dryer or sue for the cost of the car he thinks she damaged. She did not. What do I do here? I'm very overwhelmed and just trying to get my mom somewhere safe.	Yes
49	"Hi everyone, thank you in advance for any help you can provide.  My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.  She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was ""acting like a slut"" and ""dressing inappropriately"" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent ""promiscuity"". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.  I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because ""[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.""  I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a ""you're starting high school"" gift, and thought it best to wait.  I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again. I'm so angry right now I cannot think straight, and she's taking a nap. What do I need to do? Who do I need to call?"	Yes
50	My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes
51	Ex and I were together for a decade. Ex broke it off two months ago. Fine. Ex says she'll remove her stuff from the apartment and get on with it.  Except the part where she never did. And she stopped paying rent.  We are co-tenants on a lease that ends in approximatemy four months. Out of the eight months we have been here, ex has only paid rent for three.   Because we were together so long, there is only a verbal agreement of splitting the rent in half. Maybe there's a saved text or something but I never got a written contract because love I guess.  The main thing here is I can't stand being around her anymore. We had a domestic violence incident in the last year that I did not report. Staying in this apartment now is mentally and physically destroying me but I don't trust ex to 1) not steal my shit and 2) not wreck the apartment.  The only silver living here is that the landlord allows for leases to be broken with notarized signatures of both co-tenants. I've sent this is ex multiple times and they've yet to complete it. To be fair, I haven't done it either because I've been waiting on her to sign it first.   My main question is: Is there any way I can potentially just get my name off the lease? This leaves ex with the hot potato, as they say, and is the easiest way to dodge. I'm just worried about this coming back to bite me in the ass later either via a small claim or a bad landlord reference. That's probably out of the question, though, considering the early leave.   Thanks for any help you can give.	Yes
52	Hello everyone. So basically what has happened is right now I am 16 and my parents honestly hate me. They are abusive and neglect my well being and have caused a lot of mental health issues for me. Anyways I plan on leaving them FOREVER the day I turn 18 and finish school...however after today I do not think that will be possible anymore.    So what happened is that they wont allow me to buy my own car so instead bought the family a truck to use in generally, they told I have to PAY THEM BACK for a fucking 60k truck. They said once I pay them back fully It will be mine to keep however there is no way in hell i will ever be able to pay them back in fucking two years. Which means after i turn 18 i still am gonna be making them payments. I never agreed to this and I need to know   If i run away after i finish school without paying them back for this truck(which i never brough and it isnt legally mine) can they do legal action against me or like take me to court...  As of my location I live in Canada in the province of Alberta.	Yes
53	hello. I live in Wisconsin and own my own home. My boyfriend has lived here for the last 4 years. Things have progressively become more abusive. Never physical but definelty verbal. Today I was in fear it would progress. I had to call the police which required him to leave for the night, but now I am lost. The officer mentioned a 5 or 30 eviction? but any research ive done online does now help. He does not pay me rent. He does pay the electric and cable bill, although only electric is in his name. Can someone please help me because these forms make me believe the 5 and 30 difference is based on rent? he has never paid me rent. Please help. I need to go to the courthouse first thing in the morning and I am so lost.	Yes
54	He plead no contest.  I haven't seen him outside of court for 18 months.  He made a lot of false claims on the application.	Yes
55	"So I met this guy when I was 17 (a couple months away form 18). He essentially groomed me and offered me xanax and alcohol and a place to stay when I was homeless. We got very intoxicated and passed out and when I regained consciousness is when the video takes place. I didn't know that I had this video in my possession and uncovered it when I was trying to clear space off my laptop. The video depicts the following:  &gt; Both of us are naked. We're playing around with my new camera phone and seeing how long it will take video. I am acting like a drunk 17 year old. Both of us are clearly identifiable in the video. There isn't any sexual intercourse in the video however I do reference sex with him and at one point in the video I say ""I am 17 and you are 27. I did not consent to this and you are making child porn."" From the video it looks like I was holding the phone most of the time excepting the couple times he tries to grab it and film me naked. It also appears as though he might be taking pictures or recording simultaneously on his phone.   Later on in our relationship I found a hard drive with a BUNCH of pornographic pictures and highly sexual conversations with people that he had never had relationships with. It was very clear he was suffering from a sexual addiction. Our initial contact led to a two-ish year ""relationship"" that ended in him abandoning me the day before my birthday. During this time he was highly abusive about my appearance and weight. We moved to the outer banks and lived there, away from my family, friends, or any acquaintances. When he abandoned me he managed to pack up all of our valuable possessions while he sent me a couple hours away to get my nails done for my birthday and then moved cross-country to California with his business partner without notice. This included walking out on our recently co-signed car which he purchased using the entirety of my savings. I was left with a large number of animals to care for including reptiles, fish, dogs, and cats. Immediately and with precision he  1. cancelled all our joint accounts 2. blocked me on all social media 3. set up a forwarding address 4. blocked my phone number 5. gave notice to the landlord that *both* of us would be moving out immediately  It was obviously premeditated.  Even after he left he started talking to me again a few months later. He initiated sexual exchanges over skype and email pictures (because he refused to text me). He played games and led me along emotionally and then ask for a bunch of nudes. He would even mention the idea of coming back and ""visiting."" He later went on to get caught masturbating at work (by no intent of mine) while sending it to me and ceased communication after he was fired.  To this day I haven't really been in a position to take any action against him and for years I've been too emotional traumatized to see the situation clearly. When I found the video and watched it I was disgusted by how childish and intoxicated I was and am moved to take action. I feel violated, lied to, and really this event has turned my life upside down. My credit is still destroyed by the repossession and have daily anxiety.  I'm ready to take action against him. I feel like I was a minor who was very intentionally groomed. Where do I start? I currently reside in Oregon and he is located in California (I have a last known address and I can track him down). Can I report him to the police where the video was taken and will they likely take any action? I was 17 and underage (although within a couple months of 18) but clearly was groomed, given substances, and taken advantage of by a much older individual. We are both married now, this isn't a revenge thing. I don't want anything except for him to accept some kind of consequence for his wrongdoings. Thank you."	Yes
56	Dear Reddit,  I really need your help!  A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.  Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.  I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.  How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?  How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?  And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?  Tbh, I've been really scared of this day. I've been trying to avoid even talking about it but the 2-year limit is ending. I really do need you guys' advices.  Sincerely,	Yes
57	Six years ago my (now ex) boyfriend and his friend raped me. He had been pouring a flask in my drink all night and when I passed out in his bed he and his friend brought in another girl and tried to get with both of us. She got freaked out and called a taxi and left. My ex and his friend cornered me and his friend had his way with me while my boyfriend held me down.   My ex stormed out the room and called me a whore.   Fast forward to last night, I get a call from his latest girlfriend and after hours on the phone talking about the abuse we both endured with him we found out that he and his friend raped her too in the same fashion.  This guy has a history of sexually abusing women and abusing animals (put a cat in a microwave, gave a small dog a seizure from kicking her across the room, abusing this girls dog to the point where she had to give him up so he'd be safe). He is truly the scum of the earth and there is no end to the carnage he causes anyone in his life, mental and physical abuse.  I may have what constitutes as a confession from him about the sexual assault and his latest gf went to a doctor right after so that may be proof.   Now that I have this girl's experience, I know that it'll happen again and I am wondering if we have a case? There are at least 4 other women I could contact that would potentially testify against him.  Thank you for any advice.	Yes
58	"this is a very bad situation but i really just want a very straight-forward answer and not a focus on the situation at large which I am struggling to manage with a therapist.  for many years I have been sexually assaulted by my uncle in law (uncle), since i was a child. I am only now, as an adult, trying to deal with this but I am terrified for my family to know as i fear what could happen on many, many levels.  I just want it to stop. my therapist thinks I should file a restraining order (both my uncle and I are in California, as are my parents and sister) but there are frequent gatherings at my parents house (where he often assaults me late at night) and a restraining order would make all of this public immediately. my uncle in law is married to my father's sister.  these interactions have gone on in waves and sometimes i've managed to avoid him for many months at a time. recently it's gotten more frequent and intense so I decided to try to stop it. I have been avoiding him now for many weeks (he does not live in my city but visits and tries to see me). he is getting frustrated that i refuse to obey him and getting angry. he is verbally and physically abusive and, like many victims of stuff like this, i have consented to much i am ashamed about out of fear and shame. while he can be physically abusive I don't fear he would kill me or something. I know he doesn't want all this to come to light. i have told no one until recently. only my therapist and a close friend (who doesn't live in my city) now know what's happened. I am very alone.  I am afraid i can not avoid him much longer and that he will assault me. I know the answer seems obvious but when you've been abused for 20 years it's not easy to get out from under it, please believe me. this is so difficult that suicide is a constant thought rather than admit what has happened to my family.  what I was thinking was that i could hire a lawyer (I don't have much money but my friend who knows about this can help me to a degree) to deliver a letter to him stating that i have spoken with the lawyer and am prepared to issue a restraining order if he does not stop contacting me. I thought maybe the letter could say that if he ever touches me in any way I will file a police report and if he assaults me i will pursue rape charges. I don't want to go down that road but i'm not sure what else i can do.   would a lawyer do this kind of thing? is this crazy of me? i know I sound cowardly (I feel cowardly) but this is incredibly difficult and i just wnat it all to go away. I don't want to have to break my parents hearts and everything. I'm not even sure I could do it but I know that just telling him I don't ever want to see him again isn't working. he knows how much control he has and he's not afraid to use physical force.  [again, please don't provide advice along the lines of ""why don't you just tell your family"" or something as it's incredibly hurtful. if i could do this, i would. believe me.]  thank you for your advice."	Yes
59	Keeping things somewhat obfuscated for safety, if you need finer details, please PM me.  This happened in upstate SC. I am now in FL.  About 4 years ago, I offered to open up my house out of the kindness of my heart to my best friend and their spouse, who have a child. The next several months after that, it became very apparent that there were things I wasn't aware of. My friend's spouse was very abusive towards my friend, mostly verbally. I found out that my friend had been raped by the spouse as well. I confronted my friend about it after witnessing abuse towards the child too, and finally my friend recognized the need to end the relationship and demand a divorce. We filed to have the spouse evicted. My friend did not leave as they did not have anywhere to go.  My friend refused to pursue charges, mostly out of fear of things not going well, potentially some Stockholm Syndrome or something going on. The spouse accused us of cheating, openly vilified myself and my friend, and claimed to be innocent of what we witnessed.  No formal divorce or custody agreement ever entered in due to the previously mentioned fears.  There was peace some time after the split. The spouse seemed to be stabilizing. There was an agreement to allow visitation. The spouse however not only has a child with another person now, but has also kidnapped my friend's child as well, and has made wild baseless accusations.  I have been asked to submit an affidavit to what I witnessed. I am concerned that if my involvement comes forward, that the target will be drawn to me and I may have false allegations filed against me, forcing me to return back to SC, which could potentially have a number of consequences for me outside of legal. However, if I don't submit my affidavit, it could potentially weaken or ruin my friend's case and the chances of my friend's child being returned to the parent who is actually a capable parent.	Yes
60	"Not much info beyond the title. There is a history of violence in the home. He is an unrepentant alcoholic and he claims he does not remember anything that happened.   Question is: What are the next steps? I doubt he can afford a lawyer though he likely makes too much for a court appointed attorney. I know the ""right answer"" is lawyer up but I need to know what to do in the meantime. I stopped by the jail but apparently I am not allowed see him. I **will not** bail him out or put up any money for him. I'm just trying to get info to pass on to my mother. I'd let him rot if it were up to me but she's freaking out so thought I'd get some general info to calm her down.   Thanks in advance."	Yes
61	I'm a student who has been working at a Sydney cafe for a few weeks now, and, as the title states, I've been getting underpaid (cash-in-hand), given no payslips, and not given penalty rates. The other workers I have talked to have also been getting the same treatment. Since, there is no payslip there is no evidence except for word of mouth. I don't wish to take them to court because I don't want to make life-long enemies. What will happen to them if I report them to fair work?	Yes
62	"Okay I'm gonna tell you all the details. I am 18 and I was charged with domestic violence and assault. Domestic violence is false because the lady who I have an assault charge on thought for whatever reason that I was choking my girlfriend out, which never happened. My girlfriend and me were arguing and she threw my stuff out the window, so we continued to fuss and I kind of had my hands flailing in the air and I was faced towards my girlfriend in the car, opposite of the windshield. I told her there was a lady coming and I didn't want her to hear us arguing but she didn't care. So the lady ended up running to the car and she yelled get off of my girlfriend. I told her this isn't her business and my girlfriend told her I'm not doing anything to her. The lady then pepper sprayed me and it got all in my eyes and hair and neck.   Me and my girlfriend were both in the car coughing and choking on the lingering spray, so we had to exit the vehicle. I'm panicking because I can't see anything at all so I hurry to grab my stuff and get it back in the  car, then I walked towards the lady (she's in front of our car)  to get around to get in the vehicle and she tried to get her pepper spray again so I covered my face and I tried to grab it from her but, I'm still barely able to see and my face is burning and numb at the same time, and she accidently fell since I got too close to her. I got in the vehicle and my girlfriend noticed someone recording and I got out the car and I ran over to him and slipped, got back up and ran and asked why he was recording. He said because he can and I called him a racist because of the smirk he had on his face looking at me. I didn't do anything wrong to my girlfriend or that lady, yet I have these charges, and my girlfriend has already talked to the state prosecutor, but initially she told them I grabbed her wrists(and that's already considered domestic violence) when police first talked to her, but that's not how it went, we were just arguing like any normal couple, and now she doesn't say that but it's already in the police report so how can we go about her saying that to that we were just getting loud?    I'm about to go to my third court date because they keep stalling,  adding more evidence for themselves and now they're trying to get me for bail violation because I called my girlfriend in jail. She's literally the only person I talk to and the only number I knew by heart. I had to talk to her to get a hold of my dad and that's the only reason I ever got bonded out. They only have two recorded 14 minute conversations and my lawyer said I said something about not caring about staying away from her or some bs like that, and he told me that the way the judge and prosecutor thinks, they just look at the police report and go ""oh this guy choked his girlfriend and hit an old lady yep he's a bad person"" but little do they know I have never even been in trouble before and I am not a violent person whatsoever, me and my girlfriend are happily in love and have been for over 4 years, I'd never lay a hand on her, and I have so much respect for anybody, even people that are mean, because I'm too nice of a person.   Now they're going to have a jury selection and I have to talk about my bail violation in a few days. What can I do to make them not put me in jail for that?"	Yes
63	Quebec, Canada. I am the victim along with my younger sister, my father is the abuser. I frankly have no idea where to start legally - I have a few questions I hope someone can help me with. Frankly, I am terrified, this has been kept hushed in my extended family for over 20 years.   The abuse lasted from when I was in diapers to the age of 18. I remember recurring specific instances of abuse clearly, without the memory of specific dates because I was so young. Abuse included numerous and repetitive molestation and forcing me to manually stimulate him.   At the age of 5 years old, my mother was suspicious of abuse but never witnessed anything herself. My mother filed for divorce. An Aunt on my father's side called her one day saying she had witnessed him molesting me while giving me a bath during a family visit at my grandparent's house. However, this aunt was not willing to testify. At the age of 5, I was considered too young to testify in court. Without a witness, all my mother had to go on legally was suspicions. Though she fought tooth and nail, the legal system was not on her side since she had no witnesses willing to testify and no evidence except the memories of a child. The legal system failed me and my mother horrendously. She had no job, no family support and no money, and the appointed lawyer could do little for us. She was advised to try for supervised visitation, and not to try to prosecute as the case would most likely fall through, and the courts might take pity on him if he was not convicted and grant equal custody. My father ended up with supervised visits one Saturday a week. Despite this, the abuse continued. Any time someone's back was turned for one second, he would molest me - this continued at least until the age of 8 where I became more self confident to protect myself and avoided his advances, but subtle abuse and psychological abuse still remained. He remained in contact with me until the age of 18, when I became an adult and felt I had the courage to cut off all contact with him and move away without fear of him tracking me down to hurt me.  Now, 20 years later, I feel I am ready to finally face the ghosts of my past. No-one in my family would talk to me about the abuse as a child or a teenager. Which, in a way, is a good thing as it solidifies the fact that all of the memories I have are from my own experience, not from people telling me that I was abused.   I plan on getting in contact with the Aunt who witnessed the abuse, although I highly doubt she will be willing to testify if she was unwilling to do so when I was a defenseless toddler. I have several recurring, specific memories, that correlate with memories of my younger sister, who suffered the same type of abuse as myself. My older half sister, who was a teenager at the time but lived in the same house, has memories of abuse including him trying to climb into her bed and molest her at night, and showing her hardcore pornography while she was a minor. However, she lives in Malaysia currently and I am not sure she would be willing to testify.  I know it is a very long shot, as the abuse was many years ago and the memories of a young child from that long ago do not hold up well in court. But I know that if I do not do this now, I will regret it for the rest of my life. I want to get in contact with child abuse help, but I have no idea who to contact, and I know nothing about the legal system or how the case would be handled since it was such a very long time ago.   I am considering buying a hidden audio recording device, and interviewing the aunt, as well as my father, for evidence. It is legal in canada to record a conversation between two people without one party's consent, as long as the recording party is aware of it. Is there anything else I can do for evidence or to prepare for this? I want to be as prepared as I possibly can before I present the case.   This monster has molested me and my sisters, probably more family members or neighbors children that I don't even know of, and is walking free hurting more children no doubt. He is unbelievably bold and manipulative, charming, and continued the abuse under the direct supervision of my mother and case workers without anyone knowing. This will be a long, hard fight. Any advice would be welcome.	Yes
64	Who is guilty? Two brothers, one 36, one 26, live in their father's home with their mother who is ill with cancer. The two are not amicable. Great deal of bad blood. 26 claims history of violence at hands of 36.  They take turns occupying shared spaces in the home. 36 goes to work to make private income. Family income provided by the father. 26 stays at home caring for ill mother. 36 returns to house in the middle of the day. This is not typical. 26 doesn't want 36 in the house. Feels it's his time to occupy spaces. 36 just want to prepare for business trip. 26 grabs a skillet, stands at the entrance, and blocks 36 from entering house. He warns 36 not to enter. 36 comes in anyway toward 26 punching. 26 weakly swings skillet no injuries. 36 knocks skillet away. 26 jumps on 36 and bites chest and arm. 26 clings to 36s back. Fight pauses, they talk about issues. 36 gets fed up and strangles 26 with hands until he passes out. 26 calls cops. Report filed. 26 leaves home later that night to live on streets. 36 remains at home.	Yes

66	My friend had his parole transferred from another state to VA and is two months out on a 3 year parole after a lengthy prison sentence. His sister was supportive all through his sentence and offered to have him come live with her. Turns out his sister is a raging alcoholic, and her boyfriend who also live with them is an active junkie (my friend found him ODing in the kitchen one night). The sister and her bf fight nonstop keeping my buddy up all night when he has to work the next day (thankfully he found a decent job in the service industry). One night after asking them to keep it down at 4 a.m. the sister pushed my friend, hit him, and threatened to call his PO on him.  Now, the friend obviously wants out, he did not expect to be thrown into this hellhole, nor does he want to violate his parole, yet he is afraid to tell his PO the situation thinking they will throw him in a shelter (I believe the shelter here has a 10pm curfew which would cause him to lose his job). Nor does he want to live in a shelter.   I think he should just tell his PO everything, but will they actually throw him in a shelter, or are they more flexible than that. What does he do when living at the place his parole dictates can violate his parole. If anyone familiar with the system can give their best two cents that would be awesome.	Yes
67	Hi all. I really need your help. My sister was put on a 72 hour hold at a psychiatric hospital after she went in there to talk to a doctor about her depression and thoughts of suicide. 72 hours have passed and she wants to go home now but the doctor has put her on another hold. What can I do to get her out of there? This hospital is really horrible and provides no help at all. She is not taking any medications, which tells me that her depression is not that severe. They just want to exploit the patients and insurance companies. I have been trying to contact her doctor but no success so far. Please help!	Yes
68	"Michigan  A friend of mine recently let his sister-in-law stay with him and his wife when she showed up beaten by her to be ex husband. She has been there for a few days now and brought her 9 month old dog with her.  While they do want to help her they also want to be careful as she hasn't been the most trustworthy person in the past.  I've browsed around this sub enough to know that they will need to be careful that she doesn't establish residency. I've already told him not to accept any money from her under any circumstances.   What I can't find online is how long does she have to stay before she can claim residency and he would have to evict her? What other conditions besides length of stay and paying ""rent"" could she potentially use to try to claim residency?"	Yes
69	Hi my dad is abusive not physically but its enough. I cannot take anymore of this and feel like doing extreme measures just to get away. I wont go into detail to derail the post. The bills of the house (water,electric,ect) come in with his name. My mom and dad share a bank account and he is the holder on it. So he has to make the decisions my mom cant.  I dont think if we ever went to the law if would be in our favor because of this. Hes a good manipulator to others. Im afraid anything will be in favor of him. Is there anything i can do? Do i have to start recording his psychotic episodes for evidence. He does not listen to anything we say ever so talking to him is not an option for he will not listen.	Yes
70	"So I'm really lost and in need of help on this, to my ex-girlfriend has had some mental issues for quite a while that she decides to take out on me. To get into the story I have another post that can provide further insight. Me and my EXgirlfriend have had an argument about her talking to other men and her exes, because of her anger issues she goes from 0 to 100 just like that and will cuss and throw things but in our most recent argument she decided to up and move overnight, this was while I was thinking that there was something going on with her and another man. Well sure enough one of her estranged family members and a random guy helped her move out in the process she had stolen a lot of stuff for me but returned some of it. The next day her and that guy came over and we're sitting in their car in front of my driveway until I came out and trying to harass me to give me my cat to her. Now this was a feral cat that was never owned by anybody except I always paid Veterinary bills and for all other living Essentials and also has lived at my house it's whole life. Well recently she decided I have committed domestic violence against her in that argument and that she wants the cat now, even though she has no proof it's her cat. In doing that I had a court order to return the cat and there was a court date in two weeks from now. She is trying to take my cat right now and the other day while I was at work 2 police officers and my ex showed up to get the cat but the cat was outside and I was at work so they had to come back in the next days. I have visual, text, and Witnesses that show she had made a false statement. Also after I was served a temporary restraining order until the next court date where I can provide everything she kept trying to provoke and contact me calling from different numbers until one time I answered and she said right away "" I'm sorry that was the only thing I could say or do to try and get that cat"" I told her to text it to me but of course she knew what she was doing and wouldn't. She has been talking before she moved out about moving out of state and this guy that she met is from one state away but when she told me he was only a friend at the time she said he's moving back to that state soon. I fear for the life and well-being of my cat or that she will send it off.   What happens if I don't give up the cat until the court date so that I can provide my evidence that it is both my cat and she made a false statement?  How is she able to say that another animal is hers with no evidence and be granted the ability to steal someone's property?  Any questions or concerns are appreciated as this stuff is scary, thank you Reddit community."	Yes
71	Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
72	"I am 18 years old and heading to university in September. My mother has always been emotionally unstable, bipolar, bpd, and very manipulative. She never respects my privacy (goes through my things when I'm not here, steals them and won't give them back for no reason, etc) - e.g: a few months ago she stole my girlfriend and I's polaroids and wouldn't give them back because she didn't approve of me dating her (very unjustified considering my girlfriend never showed any reason not to be with her). She never lets me close the door to my room because ""I shouldn't have anything to hide"" and ""there shouldn't be any secrets between us"".  More recently I bought a watch with money I had saved for years, and she just called me to tell me she's going to take the watch and return it (and most likely keep the money). My parents being divorced I left for holidays with my father and left my watch at home.   I don't know what to do anymore: She has been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive with me for YEARS, which has caused me to develop depression, severe insecurity and low self-esteem and anger management issues. Nonetheless, I have never gotten physically agressive with her. This watch I bought is one I hold very dear, and being 18 I don't think she's allowed to steal my things and sell them without my consent.   What should I do?"	Yes
73	A person I know was hit in the head by her husband in Virginia. If she goes to a doctor, will they have to report it to the police? Everything I could find on the subject seemed to say that mandatory reporting only applied if a weapon was used.	Yes
74	"My brother is a horrible sociopath and drug abuser. My mother has been one of those mothers who has been blinded by motherly love in the past, and has enabled him for the past twenty years. But now it has reached a point where she fears for her life. So last year she took out a restraining order against him.  However, whenever the police take him away... they seem to release my brother from custody after a few days. I don't actually know the law, but I'm told that my brother is classified as mentally-ill by the state, and according to the law, they cannot hold mentally-ill in jail. So over the past several years one of three things, happen... they release him to a homeless shelter, or the county hospital, and one time even a church. And from there he is released, and able to come back to my mother's house where he starts the abuse, and the cycles starts all over again.   In the past, she would even bring my brother home herself because, even after physical violence, she would say ""he is still my son and I love him"". But because the type of drugs he abused got harder and harder, and the physical, mental, and financial abuse got worse and worse, she finally was able to get a restraining order against him.  However, my brother has found another loophole to this restraining order law: Police can only remove people violating a restraining order if they are outside the house. What he does is hop the backyard gate and sneak into the house. According to my mother, the police have told her that they can no longer remove my brother if he is already inside the house.  My brother currently has a case against him for violent abuse against my mom, but the next court date is in late September, but I fear she won't last long in her current state.  My questions:  1) Am I misinformed in that mentally-ill persons cannot be kept incarcerated in California? If that is indeed in the case, what options do we have to forcible keep my brother away from my mom at least until the court hearing date?  2) Can the police really do nothing if my brother is already inside the house on the restraining order?  3) Can a restraining order be made null and void if my brother argues that my mother voluntarily took him back?"	Yes
75	"Basically, my friend is willing to come up with the 4k to break the lease, however, the apartment management requires a signature from both people and her ex is refusing to sign until she ""meets with him alone"".  Which is obviously dangerous.   The apartment complex is looking into if they can do anything on their end, but until then, what are her legal rights?"	Yes
76	So let me preface by saying that I am in no way defending my actions, or the way I behaved. It was completely unacceptable, and I feel horrible and stupid for it.  Saturday night my girlfriend, lets call her Vee, and I went out for a couple of drinks. At the end of the evening we both had gotten a little tipsy, and started having an argument on her porch, which then escalated into the kitchen, with the door still open.  In my drunken idiocy I knocked over a pile of glasses onto the floor.  At this point we both notice a cop car with lights on coming down the street. They say they had a report of a domestic dispute, put me in cuffs, put me in the car. All the while she is saying she does not want me arrested, to release me, and that she is refusing to press charges.  Of course they don't let me go, I spend the night in central bookings. When I go before the judge, he tells me that I have an order of protection against Vee. I am in no way allowed to contact her, to speak to her, to be within 100 feet of her, if I do, and should I be caught, I will be arrested and charged with contempt of court.   The judge let me go on my own recognizance, no bail, and I am scheduled to appear back in court in September with a lawyer of my own - furthermore, I don't even know what I am being charged with?  My question is Vee and I have no absolutely no desire for this order of protection. We get along, love each other, and are planning a future together. This was just a stupid spat that got escalated way further than anyone ever would have thought. We practically live together, and spend all of our free time together.  At this point, how exactly should we proceed? I am at a complete loss of what to do. How do I even find out what I am being charged with, and when I contact a lawyer what should I tell them, will they be able to find out what my charges are?	Yes
77	Let's say I have friend who is currently in an extremely abusive relationship to the point where it is affecting her work. I am also her supervisor. Would it be possible for me to ask for a restraining order from her boyfriend? Let's say she is in such a bad state the she cannot ask herself, is being forced not to. But me, along with a few other people see how bad it is and want to get her out. Therefore if we have several people that can attest to this, could this make a difference? Like can we make an argument that she has been abused so badly she cannot make this decision for herself? If this is not technically possible, what is my next best course of action?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
78	I just got a phone call from my girlfriend who is currently moving into her apartment with her mother in New York, all the information I have about the situation is through her and the accuracy may not be 100%. She received a phone call from her brother (16), who does not have his license, took their mother's car out on the highway, with multiple passengers, and caused a crash which totaled both his car and another.   From my understanding he is at fault, but all parties involved survived the accident, though I do not know the extent of any injuries.   What should they do? Would it be considered theft that he took the car without permission or supervision, with the owner halfway across the country? Depending on their insurance provider could their mother maintain her rates due to the accident being caused by someone not covered by insurance?  With a single mother putting one child through college and another going into his final year of high school, they don't have much money-mainly what is the best way to minimize financial damages? Thank you.	Yes
79	"So my dad is trying to evict me, he doesn't have anything legal. He wants me to work for him, and is consistently harassing me until I do (I'm in between jobs and I'm looking for one ACTIVELY.) He was harassing me this morning in his room, yelling into mine. I went to his bedroom calmly. I asked why I have to work for him and why he is trying to take my car away (he bought it, pays for everything for the car), when I am actively looking for a job. He got angry. Shouted, charged me, and I backed up. He was pushing my hands away and spitting into my face. I backed up into my room next door, and he was still in my face arguing with me so I threw a punch and it landed. It busted his lip open. He's trying to file a police report. He took my phone and my car away from me.   This is not the first time we have had a fight. Last time I accidentally closed the door on my mom's finger during an argument, so he dragged me out of the bathroom by my hair and stomped on my back - knocking the wind out of me. The police that came searched my room for drugs, and they ultimately told my father he has every right to put his hands on me if I'm ""being disrespectful"".   So the police WILL take his side. They told me if I don't like it, get out.   He IS verbally abusive. EXTREMELY so. But he rarely fist fights with me.   How do I avoid going to jail?"	Yes
80	So, my girlfriend's ex was abusive and manipulative both emotionally and monetarily.  He is now sending her unsolicited text messages and generally harassing her.  She also needs to pick up some things from his apartment.  What is the best course of action for her?	Yes
81	What actions can she take? I tried looking up resources, but it seems like it's either the family court or calling the police. She's terrified for her life. Her mother doesn't have enough money to leave the situation.	Yes
82	I was involved in a self defense shooting recently. It was a domestic issue. I do not have a lawyer. They took my pistol &amp; the investigation is still open.   The detective arrived on scene shortly after &amp; preceded to ask me questions. I decided to tell my side of the story without a lawyer present. I do not have one.  I took a recorded statement at the precinct &amp; was released. No charges were filed. The aggressor was rushed to intensive care. He did not die.   My questions are: Was it bad for me to speak without a lawyer present, despite the fact that I was released. Do I need to get one? And who do I contact in regards to remaining anonymous with the press?	Yes
83	"Hello! 21 year old girl here. I was assaulted by my ex-boyfriend at least 4 times in a single night. Went to the police and told them everything. In my ptsd therapy, I'm beginning to remember incidents that built up to the March event.  I've been trying to contact the police officer who documented everything, but sometimes it takes a while to hear back.   In the mean time, we wait for the legal proceedings. Its been months. I will testify to a grand jury, and one thing has been bugging me.   So much happened that night, but there were so much more that happened in the months that built to that. On the spot, I don't think i'll be able to remember all those details. Its been hard enough recalling them after my physical and mental state left the ""survival"" fight-or-flight response mode. Will I be allowed a paper full of notes into the court room? I left out a lot of details in the Restraining Order hearing, simply because i forgot a lot of stuff. The hearing was only a few weeks after the assaults.   I would do much better if I had notes with me, but is that even allowed? I've never been a victim in a criminal case before, much less a victim of domestic violence."	Yes
84	"My Gf asked me to go to the beach with her dad and his wife, who is not her mother. We were all drinking one night and me and my gf were playing around wrestling which was a bad idea cause she started to get mad when she thought I was getting too aggressive. We stopped, I thought we were just playing around cause she started laughing and lunged at me which caused me to fall back and she hit her head in the ground hard. I immediately asked if she was ok and tried to check on her but she freaked out and said leave me alone, don't talk to me etc. and ran to her room with our 8 month old son who was sleeping. I kind of just layed there and was like what the hell just happened before going inside. Well her dad was in the doorway asking what was wrong and she tells him that I body slammed her to the ground which was not true. She claims she wanted my attention and her emotions always get the best of her when she is drinking. So anyway, her dad starts yelling at me saying all these things like next time I touch her he is gonna beat my ass and all this stuff making me out to be some abusive boyfriend. At this point I am looking him straight in the eyes saying ""I hear you"" ""I understand"" and we are both raising our voices. He then threatens me by saying ""I will go to your house and slap your mother"" this obviously pisses me off and I go on to say ""no the fuck you won't"" etc. next thing I know I'm hit the eye and we are wrestling around in the kitchen. He has me by the hair and is beating me in the side of the head while my gf is trying to break it up and he won't stop. He was also drinking. I can't even say if I hit him or not but I was just trying to defend myself. I eventually get up and say ""you got me, you win"" he calls me a piece of shit and I start packing all our things to leave. Later I find out he told my gf ( his daughter) fuck you and he pushed her out the door and when he did he ended up clipping her on the chin with his first. At this point I have no idea what I should do, I have a huge black eye, bruises over my head and my nose was bleeding. I have pictures of everything after it happened."	Yes
85	Hi Reddit,  Sorry if this is lengthily there is a lot of background info. I live with my boyfriend and he has a 5yr old from a previous relationship. Last September it was discovered that the bio-mom's boyfriend was beating up the son and the mom was aware of it and also admitted to being complacent in the abuse. The DA refused to press charges saying that these cases are hard to get a convection on. The son was taken away from his mother and my boyfriend had sole physical custody for a period of two months. Then CPS agreed that the mother should get visitation rights and set out other guidelines she needed to follow. Note my boyfriend still has full legal custody.  The mother was told she had to attend parenting classes, attend personal therapy. That the cps agent would be doing monthly home inspections. She still lives with her parents, and that cps would meet with her once a month to check in. They went to court in February and the mother had done nothing. CPS recommended giving my boyfriend sole physical custody and determined she was an unfit mother. The court overruled that and gave her an extension to start the program. My boyfriend was obviously upset and tried to appeal but CPS told him they would follow up and ensure she was doing the things and that there would be home visits.  Since the last court date there is a new CPS worker and she is terrible. The son disclosed to my boyfriend that his mom was still dating his abuser and my boyfriend reported that to cps since it was violating court orders. CPS worker said there was no way to confirm it. A couple weeks ago when I was babysitting the boy he told me how if he doesn't listen his mom will hit him and that his grandpa beats him with a wooden spoon if he doesn't listen. I told this to cps &amp; put her supervisor on the email and never got a response. Also almost fot the whole month of June the mother refused to pick up her son at the scheduled times: while we obviously didn't mind the extra time my boyfriend had his lawyer file a complaint so it would be on the record. In response to this the CPS worker told my boyfriend he needs to take co-parenting classes to learn how to negotiate with his ex better.   They go to court in two weeks for another check in and today his ex sent him part of an email exchange she had with the worker asking some questions but the earlier part of the exchange is the worker and his ex talking about her getting more custody and some tax stuff which is not even in CPS' jurisdiction.   My boyfriend and I are very upset about this, not just that his son could end up spending more time with an abusive parent but simple because the worker has been in communication with the mom while ignoring any communication we've had. So my question is is there someone else to bring this up with outside if cps? Or should we have the lawyer bring it up in court? Also neither of us has dealt with CPS before so is there a way to appeal A decision from them?  Thanks!	Yes
86	Colorado. I was assaulted by my (ex)partner last night, him being taken to jail and I to the hospital. He was seen by a judge today and I have a Mandatory Protection Order that specifically mentions the apartment we are both on the lease for.   About an hour ago I received a three day notice to quit for substantial violation. Am I out of luck or is there protection for me since I was the victim?  I will be calling around when offices open tomorrow, but right now I am scared I will have to move on my own in three days. If I left anything out I am very sorry.  TL;DR He broke the lease by assaulting me. Do I have to move or can I fight a notice to quit?	Yes
87	I was born as a 2nd child in china when the 1 child policy was still in effect. I became an american citizen in 2016.(Seattle, WA).  My parents changed my birthday when i was born so there wouldn't be any legal consequences. The only correct birthday is on my Chinese birth certificate. Is there a way i can legally get my birthday corrected? What would be my first course of action?	No

89	I have a roommate. My grandpa is very sick and needs someone to care for him. What are my rights as a tenant?

Is there anything I can do to get off the lease in this situation?	No
90	This is in KS.  My father passed away this morning. I am helping my mother through the process.  My family, including my mother, is worried about my brother going forward at this point. He has leeched off my parents his entire adult life, and now that my dad has passed we fear my brother's sense of grief and sympathy will not overpower his entitlement and he may try to take property or try to get money from my mother in her vulnerable state.   My father had a (small) life insurance policy and gets SSI. Other than that their assets are all in farmland/machinery/livestock.  What is the best way to go about making sure my mother is protected going forward so her, not my brother's, best interests are met?  Thanks.	No
91	Hello, I will attempt to condense this to the core of the issue, but I'm seeking advice as this information just came to my attention yesterday.   I live in California, and I purchased a new vehicle in Texas in April.  The dealership  said they would handle registering for me in California, that they had done this before.  Fast forward 2 months, a week before my temp tags were going to expire and I contact them asking what the status was, as my tags were about to expire. This prompted a flurry of emails which quickly became apparent, that they had dropped the ball with my paperwork and only just got started.  They issued me a new set of tags for another two months.*(which I question the legality of the new tags, since they have a purchase date displayed that doesn't match my paperwork, I assume because temp tags can only have a 2 month limit... But I digress, I hope I wont get pulled over by police and need to explain)* They also requested that I get my vehicle VIN inspected, and a smog check completed.  Upon getting those two things done, the VIN inspector told me I would need to get it weighed as well since it was a truck, so I got that done as well, and the dealership then told me that was needed afterall...  Good thing I was told by the VIN guy.  All additional paper work was sent a couple of weeks ago, which I followed up on multiple times.  All was quiet until yesterday when I receive an email from the finance director, who this particular individual I have had zero contact with up to this point.    &gt;We have been notified by our titling agency that the State of California is requiring  &gt;more in taxes to register your vehicle.  The amount that was used was calculated on  &gt;the Base MSRP **as requested**, but California has calculated it using the Sale Price. &gt;If you have any questions regarding this amount feel free to contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx &gt; and I will do my best to assist you.  The above **as requested** line is the one I have an issue with, this sounds like they are trying to cover their butt, and it makes it sound as if I requested that they calculate the sales tax differently than they should have.  I did not make any such request, nor did I even know that they did that until yesterday.  April is a long time ago, and I thought all the financials were squared away.  The amount that I owe all of a sudden is not trivial, it is $1670.24.  That is a large mistake, one that I feel the dealership should take some responsibility for.  Do I have any recourse?  Should I expect the dealership to cover some or all of this?  What would be the proper approach to take in your opinion.  Many thanks.	No
92	I have a two bed one bath rented out in a multi family complex in Alameda. The rent was originally at $1350 and I raised it to $1700 in August 2016 without being aware that there was a rent control ordinance in effect. All rent increases above 5% had to go through a certain procedure, and because I was not aware of it, failed to comply with it then. However, I recently found out about it and was planning to follow the proper procedures for this year's rent increase. I wanted to increase the rent to $2000, taking into note that the apartment was not refurnished, as most 2 bedrooms in Alameda are at least $2200. However, because I did not comply with the procedures the first time, I have to refund back the difference in rent to the tenant as the rent increase was invalid. Therefore, I would have to pay the tenant $4200. And they have determined that the rent increase should be from $1350 to $1500 for this year. What can/should I do now to ensure the least losses?	No
93	Recently my boyfriend and I signed a lease agreement online for a large apartment rental company. We signed the agreement after speaking about everything through email and phone call.  The lease states rent of 1177 dollars and a deposit of 450 dollars.   We were told the deposit would be the same as our rent due to lack of rental history, as 450 is the standard rate for superior applicants.  I only noticed after it had been signed and received by management, reviewing it one more time before we go in with money and our walk through tomorrow.   Since the lease is signed, are we free to give them the lower deposit?	No
94	He constantly holds it over my head that I am going to be left under a bridge without my children once he does get this money. I don't know what to add other than I've worked less than him throughout our marriage. Mostly because of childcare costs. There was a time that i was working two jobs and he wasn't.   Please ask me for details... i dont know what to add that is relevant	No
95	I love listening to true crime podcasts, and from time to time I hear about cases where someone is abducted and held captive for 20+ years. These people are often declared dead years after disappearing before being found alive. If a victim is declared dead and a life insurance policy pays out, does the beneficiary have a legal obligation to repay the policy payment if the person is found alive at a later date? Is there a time restriction?	No
96	I recently signed a contract with Jukin Media granting them the rights to license my video to other media outlets. I was offered $200 up front for signing and 70% of all revenue made from the video.      I didn't research the company as much as I should, and now I'm wanting out. I have not filled out any personal info that would allow them to pay me, so as far as the contract states, they can't use the video. The contract said this about terminations:      &gt;T4. Termination. Licensor may seek to terminate this Agreement at any time; however, this Agreement shall only be terminable upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of which may be granted or denied in Jukin’s sole discretion. No termination shall impact any prior license of the Images by Jukin prior to termination, which shall continue in full effect under the terms of this Agreement.      Since I cannot be paid and they cannot use the video because of that, I don't see why they would want to deny the termination request, since the video would seemingly be in limbo.      But I was wanting to ask about the wording of that excerpt. Does it imply that if the contract is terminated, they will still retain rights to use the video, despite the fact that the contract associated with it was cancelled?	No
97	I just found out that my piece of garbage uncle stole my grandpa's home equity.   My grandpa's house is worth $550,000, and he had paid off almost $400,000 with 6 years of payments left before. I'm 22 so I don't really understand the real estate terminology, but he refinanced the house and took out a HELOC. Now the mortgage has basically been reset to 30 years and the new price of the house. On top of that, the payments on the house have risen by almost $600 per month because of the appraisal. My grandpa is almost 96 and doesn't understand these kinds of documents, he just signs where he's told. My uncle took the money and made a downpayment on a $1 million house.  What recourse do we have?	No

I'd really like to put them on my insurance and enroll them in school. What do I need to do? I'm at a complete loss."	No
99	When i started, and was attending university, my father never let me see any of the paper work, i was there on grants, which covered my tuition (and according to my father, my housing as well) i was never given any information regarding my finances regarding my time there, all of it was sent to his email, this went on for four years, i asked pretty regularly to see the paper work (student emails saying forms were due when i asked generally FAFSA and what have you) during my last semester i received an email saying i needed to take an online loan repayment course (this came from the school to my student email) so i went to the studentloan.gov site only to find i had an account byt could not sign in, upon further investigation i found my father had made the account and the emails from the sites routed to his email. I asked him about this many times and he delflected the question and blame. Later that year my older sister who had graduated was informed she had students loans taken out during her time (mind younshe was on the same set of grants as i) so i decided to dig around in my student information from my school, low and behold over 35k in student loans i never knew about. Or signed for.    Is there legal action i can take to help this at all? I the only reason i went to college to begin with was because I was told my grants/scholarship paid for everything.  Important note, my father has also commited various amounts of identity theft on myself, my mother and my sisters. Going so far as to take all the equity out of the house i grew up in and lose the house.  Tldr version: My father signed papers with my name agreeing to accept government loans to pay for housing in college and kept me in the dark about it.  Please help, im not a savant on this kind of thing and need advice.	No
100	Hey everyone, I was recently accepted into a neuroscience PhD program and I'm concerned about an upcoming background check. Around 5 years ago I was arrested with two felony counts of possession of a controlled substance. However, I was never convicted of anything and the case was dropped. During the application process, I correctly answered no when I was asked if I had ever been convicted of a crime. I never had arrest record expunged and I'm concerned that my offer will be removed due to being arrested. I'm hoping since I was never convicted of anything that they won't care, but I can't help but worry. I've already notified my current employer that I'm leaving and signed a lease on an apartment in the city I would be going to school in. If my admission offer gets pulled I will be screwed and have no idea what I would do. I'm wondering if I should preemptively explain my situation and how I've dealt with it would be of any benefit. I've also never been in trouble before or since.  Any advice or related anecdotes would be greatly appreciated. Also, I'd rather not post my location or where I would be attending school due to privacy issues. Thanks.	No
101	So I know there are tons of gaming news websites out there and all of them use screenshots, but I'm a newbie when it comes to the legal aspect.  Am I required to ask the game developer/publisher for permission? Do I have to reference the source?   Or can I just freely publish any screenshots I took myself of the game in the context of news or updates to the game.  Any help would be appreciated.	No
102	Basically as title says. Got my son a contract with sprint, hes 16 so I pay for everything, got him a brand new LG V20 with a lease style contract under the condition that he worked for his uncle on the weekends.   Well 16 year olds will be 16 year olds and he skipped out on more than 7 days worth of work. So punishment was I returned the phone to sprint and got him a basic flip phone with no data.   I returned the phone to a corporate sprint store and paid a 35 restocking fee. I have a digital receipt from the store that shows the model and serial number of the phone returned.   Somehow sprint lost the phone between the time I was given a receipt and now.   They sent me a bill for 423.72.   100 of that is my monthly payment and the other part is the cost of the phone I returned.   I called last month when this happened and filed a dispute. Heard nothing back from them.   This month I receive a pay or disconnect notice for the outstanding balance of 320 for the price of the phone. So I called very mad  but kept my cool. Talked with a supervisor and she seemed very helpful until the end. She said she would start another claim and it would be a week for the resolution.   I asked her what happened with the first dispute and she said there was no resolution. I asked her what that means and she said she was unsure. She said she would place a hold on my account for the 320 to make sure it does not disconnect my service, but that hold would expire at the end of the claim.   Well that happened today. I called again and made sure to speak to the same lady. I even waited on hold for 45 minutes to make this happen. She tells me that the claim was denied. No reason for the claim being denied was given.  I asked her if she had the receipt. She said no. I sent her my digital copy of the receipt. She agreed that his was an official receipt and was able to verify it in the system. But that I still owe for the phone.   She has a receipt that she agrees is legit showing I returned the phone. So I did my part here. How can she claim I owe her money for a phone I followed procedure with? IS there any legal ground for her to say I owe for an expensive phone they lost?  Texas if that matters.	No
103	"First post and I'm on mobile so I apologize for the errors/formatting.  Beginning of April A tree has fallen on the back side of my property and is now blocking my path down the hill. Since there was no storm the previous night I checked out the roots of the tree and found grey looking water seeping from the hillside where the tree was. So I decided to contact the health department to see what was up. So I got ahold of the county health department.He said he'd come out and investigate.   April 14th I showed him the water lying underneath the tree. He asked if it was my property, I told him it was on the line seeping into my property and over my bank. He said he'd have to test the water to see if its sewage or not, and to not say anything to my neighbor, ""let me handle it, don't act like you even know me.""   Couple days pass and I notice a large amount of mosquitos laying eggs in the water. The health department sends me some mosquito dunks to deal with that problem, and I ask what's the progress on my case. He tells me that he can't get ahold of my neighbor by phone or knocking on his door, and that there is no record of him installing this sewage tank.   End of June He gets back to me and tells me he ran a test on the water by sending dye down his sink drain and let it run for an hour while he sat and talked to my neighbor. He couldn't find any dye in the grey water so he tells me it can't be from his sewage and that it must be 100 year old leaf water (whatever that is.) Basically telling me I should just drop the whole thing.   Mid July Not satisfied with this I called them again and asked to please not close my case, what else can I do. He told me to take it up with the state. So I called them and they sent over two vials for me to sample the water and send it back to them to be tested.   Yesterday I filled both vials and drove it to Charleston myself.   This morning They called and told me the results and emailed them to me as well and said my neighbors line must have busted or something, test results show positive.  Vial 1 E. coli-present-670 per 100mL  Total coliforms-present-17,329 per 100mL  Vial 2 E. coli-present-591 per 100mL  Total coliforms-present-24,196 per 100mL    So where do I stand? The sewage is eroding my trees and hillside at the back of my property. The man at my county health department apparently dropped the whole part of my neighbor not even installing the tank legally/through the county.   Is there any legal action I can take to have my neighbor remove his septic tank and have it properly installed?"	No
104	Last year while I was visiting Paris, I purchase a rather expensive pair of boots I had been saving up months for. I figured I'd buy them in Europe since it's cheaper there ($1036) instead of $1293 in USA. I was told by the salesperson that I would receive a VAT tax refund at the airport after filling out several forms at the shop that I would just have to see customs and get my tax (about $120)refunded to me there.  I got to the airport, waited in a long line, almost missing my flight and the agents told me that I didn't have the correct form.  When getting home, I emailed the boutique explaining that I was unable to receive my money.  The sales person offered to speak to me via WhatsApp and gave me instructions how I could go to my local French Consulate and pay a 35 Euro fee to file the VAT tax return form to EU Customs located in Ireland. I gathered all the documents and made multiple trips to the consulate since each time I kept forgetting the appropriate documents. I mailed everything out, waited about 3-4 weeks and received no update. It's been about 8 months since then and I still have not received my money, even after emailing them several times and having them tell me that they'd look into this.   I know it's only $120 but I paid $35 and the sales associate said that the company would refund me for the fee and I went through all that trouble and they promised I would get it. I am visiting paris next month so I thought I could speak to their sales manager, but what can I do at this point?   Thanks	No
105	I live in California, and about a year ago we got a new neighbor. My family has lived in this house for almost 30 years and have never had a problem with neighbors before this.  Since he has moved in he has completely renovated his house, installed an outdoor pool and a bunch of cinder block walls around his property. With the addition of multiple cameras (at one point he had one pointing directly at our backyard/backdoor), his house and yard are hidden completely from the street.   From practically day 1 he has been hosting loud parties that go all day and long into the night. This has progressed into him installing an outdoor speaker that looks like this one: https://www.amazon.com/degree-Outdoor-speaker-Sound-Appeal/dp/B00C41AUDU   My problem is he has this speaker set up between our houses in a yet to be completed driveway. It does nothing to help the acoustics of his parties, instead it is about 10-15 feet from my bedroom window, and he plays music with driving base parts all day and all night, EVERY DAY. It keeps me awake until well after 10:30pm, and wakes me consistently around 6:30-7am every day.   I have called the police repeatedly and most of the time they don't even show up. When they do he doesn't even answer the door for them. This neighbor has set the volume such that it isn't loud enough to bother any of the surrounding neighbor enough to stand with my family in trying to end this psychological warfare. This isn't even the extent of the harassment, only the most obnoxious and persistent.  We know that he's upset that my parents are beekeepers because of emails between my mother and him. He claims we are endangering his wife's life, because she's allergic to bees, and has threatened to call code enforcement on us if we don't remove the bees. We have tried to educate them on the fact that bees are EVERYWHERE and even if we didn't care for them, the minute danger of being stung by bees is easily avoidable if you don't aggravate them.   This neighbor has made good on his threats and called code enforcement on everything that he can, from the bees themselves to structural integrity of the out-building they are living on. We are dealing with the legwork and paperwork for this but all of this is placing undue stress and suffering on my family and I need help.   I have pictures and a video (that I don't think I can post here) of this speaker playing music near my bedroom window, but my family doesn't have the money to fight this asshole (who seems to have more money than most third world countries), and I'm reaching my wits end with this asshole.   TLDR: Asshole neighbor plays loud bass music all day every day, watches my family looking for anything and everything he can to make our lives miserable. All because he's afraid that his wife will get stung by bees and die.	No
106	I'd like to take care of my warrant from June 2016. The warrant is for failure to appear for a violation of probation for not showing up to probation (I'm on probation in a county 7 +hours away).   I was convicted of domestic battery and sentenced to:  60 days in jail  3 years probation  52 weekly classes  Restitution  Probation would have expired April 2017, but it has been revoked since June 2016. I believe that would make it 10 months left.   Classes were finished October 2015, but I still owe most of the restitution.   What kind of time am I looking at and what's the best way to minimize that?  Is it more likely they will entirely revoke probation and I serve out the max one year minus 60 days served?  Or is it possible to avoid/minimize jail time and get off probation if I pay entire restition balance?   Also, I'm 7+ hours north of Ventura. Is there a way to hire an attorney to appear 977 for my mandatory appearance ? The protective order expired in April 2017.   Thanks for the advice!	No
107	(Ohio, USA). Despite being a minor, does the kid have any rights or privileges after the divorce is said and done? i.e. can they decline going to the opposite parents house, choose whose house they want to be at, etc.	No
108	My sister has been bouncing around from place to place for the last eight years. She had my nephew five years ago when she was living in a very rural part of North Carolina, and spent some time in various communes or squats elsewhere in the US.  For a good amount of that time, she was with this guy “David.” David is not my nephew’s biological father but he’s as good as. My sister and David also have a 4-month-old daughter together. She was born in Washington and also doesn’t have a birth certificate.  For medical reasons, my sister decided to return to civilization. She, David, and the two kids have been living with me while they sort things out.  But I/we honestly have no idea how to legalize the kids’ existence. I’ve been talking to David and my sister about it, but it’s overwhelming and there’s no money for a lawyer or anything.  There's basically no record of either kid. No schools, hospital visits, etc. The only thing is a recent emergency room visit for the 5-year-old (which is what prompted the return to civilization in the first place).  My sister was born here in Massachusetts, but there’s no record of her residency at the approximant time of either kid’s birth. David is legally allowed to be in the US but he’s not actually a citizen. Again, there’s no record of his residency at the time of either kid's birth.  David and my sister aren’t married though they’re open to a city hall wedding if it makes the paperwork/immigration easier. David has also said he wants to put his name on the 5-year-old’s birth certificate as well, and I’m not sure if that makes things easier.  The goal is to get both kids birth certificates, get the 5-year-old in school for this fall, get medical insurance/care for both kids, and eventually get them passports so they can meet David's family.  We’re anticipating a lot of legwork on this but we don’t even know where to start.	No
109	Multiple months ago my fiance and I signed a lease with our landlord to move to a different duplex to live without roommates. Today they called to say the family where we are supposed to move to hasn't moved out. They thought the lease ended in December. They are trying to get us to move to much shitier apartments at a unreasonable rent. They have already leased our current place to others. What do we Do? They are now offering we move to the apartment for a month while they try to evict the people in what was supposed to be our new place. What should we Do?	No
110	Yesterday, I was given an application to rent from an apartment complex, I disclosed that I was building my credit and that I had none. I filled out the application and turned it in, they gave me a signed lease which I signed as well. The lease has no mention of at-will termination of contract on either side, or demanding of a cosigner in place of a non-credit holding tenant. Today I was called and told I needed a cosigner and that my apartment wasn't secured until I had one. Do I really need the cosigner?	No
111	"Background stories: [part 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/work/comments/6jppv8/noticed_an_employee_acting_very_strange/) [part 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6lrybr/work_reported_an_employee_who_is_making_me/)   I work in an office area in a warehouse. To make it short, I've been experiencing an employee/stalker since June 23rd, 2017 in the workplace. I've noticed a pattern in his behavior of pacing near me and attempting to contact me during my lunch and breaks. He has been confronted by HR that he makes me uncomfortable and to not be around me after I have reported him a second time. I have reported THREE incidents to my HR. She claims she does not know what to do and that he does not 'listen'.  * 1st incident: Reported the first time explaining I am uncomfortable during my lunch and breaks and that I had a feeling an employee was recording me. I had a gut feeling when I saw his phone angled differently, along with his slow pace of walking. HR made the excuse that his eyesight was bad, my manager said the most wrong things like: ""Stand up for yourself and say something,"" joked that there has been 4 marriages in the company, and to try being ""friendly."" * 2nd incident: He attempted to say hi to me and I ignored him. I got up to go to the office and he was behind me, chanting ""you need a physical"" 3 times. I reported it and he was confronted by HR and my manager. They confronted me shortly after and told me that the employee told them he did not attempt to contact me, and that he was chatting with two other people who were around, which is FALSE. He attempts to talk to me when I'm alone. HR and manager told me his lunch and break times will be changed, and that she wanted 'proof' and gave me permission to record. * 3rd incident: Yesterday. Employee passed by, pacing by slowly near the door-less entry of the area that I sit in. I grow extremely uncomfortable and after my break was finished, I went into the office and confronted my HR telling her that I can't focus, and that he is effecting my work. Luckily I caught the incident on my phone and was able to show them the 'evidence' that they wanted, which is ridiculous. During this time, my manager said more stupid shit like ""would you feel comfortable if all 4 of us talked"" and ""have you tried to confront him""? HR asks what I want them to do, and I tell them ""I don't know"" even though the clear answer is I WANT HIM FUCKING GONE! After my first break, I changed the location of where I have my lunch and last break. Near the end of the day, he had the audacity to walk into the office and be near me, talking to a fellow office co-worker. He has never had to step foot into in the office prior to that.  Assuming that the warehouse manager was confronted yesterday and that the employee did not see me in the usual location for my lunch and last break, I'm assuming he had the intent to violate my safe space in the office. I felt so fucking violated and I was trying my best not to visibly show that I was uncomfortable.   In addition to his unacceptable behavior, he has walked out on the job a couple of days ago and came back the next day. He has been late to work multiple times and he is currently on a 3 month work-probation. I don't know why they won't fire him when there's so many things he's getting away with. I'm assuming that the only reason is because the warehouse positions are so hard to fill.   I have not confronted the owner of the company since she is out of town, but I definitely will this upcoming week. What should I do until then, and when she does come back in town, how do I approach this issue? I really like my job and would like to grow my position with this company, but this employee is seriously creating a hostile work environment. It's so ridiculous that my HR and manager wanted 'video evidence' when I reported him a second time. I've spent all my breaks and lunch busy recording on my phone.  edit: sorry for the awful grammer. I am really, really emotionally distressed right now. If anyone wants clarification, I will be happy to provide details. It sucks that this has going on for way too long and that I even worry about work on my days off."	No
112	Like the title states when I was 19 I was an escort for about a year. I was groomed into it by a man I met online. Tony. When I met him I was under the impression he wanted to be my sugar daddy. Instead I was greeted by him and a couple of his girls at a nice hotel. One girl in particular was the star of the show. We were all taken care of by her. Her name was Mo. They promised up to 1,000$ a day for my services. I didn't have a choice I had nothing. We were forced to see up to 8 guys in a single day. Then cut our profit with Tony.  However eventually I came to my senses, took my cash and cut ties. It was incredibly corrupt. They remained bitter at me, sending the occasional threatening message. Very petty nothing worth worrying about. He had my real information such as my email &amp; full name.   Cut to about a year later and a former client sends me a news article. Seems Tony got greedy and started his own service. Except he had really fucked up. He was a third striker caught with an underage girl. Mo lured her in so she was also caught and they went to jail. I was completely removed from their life when they made these choices. Cut to three days ago. I get an email from a detective. He knows my full name. He wants to speak to me immediately. Wants to know everything I know. What the heck do I do!!! I'm terrified.	No
113	We just moved out of our apartment in FL after doing a walk through and being charged a $75 cleaning fee. They said everything seemed good and we would get our last water bill later on.  Today we got a bill for ($70) for the water. We moved out mid month and usually the water bill was ($40) for the whole month.  They also charged us ($295) for replacing the living room carpet, which they had seen during the walk through.  After doing some research online I found that normal wear and tear does not allow them to ask the tenant to pay for it. I guess it had some stains where the furniture had been sitting. But the carpet was old when we moved in.  We did not take pictures because of the walk through, we assumed everything was fine.  What do we do/say from here?	No
114	I moved into my apartment in March. The complex is designed so each unit is accessed from the outside. The stairways are covered, but are open on all sides. When I was viewing the apartment, I noticed a number of bird's nests in the stairwells, several of which were directly outside the door of the unit I am now renting. I was assured by the lady showing the place that the bird's nests would be removed before the spring. I was a bit desperate for a place, so I believed them and moved in.   Of course, the nests were not moved, and are now full of little baby birds. I think they are swallows, but I'm not certain. I didn't mind them at first, but they've quickly started to cause some problems. First, they are filthy. There is bird shit everywhere. I can't set foot outside my front door without stepping in a huge pile of bird shit. My indoor cat got a tapeworm. She has never set foot outdoors and I can't imagine the flea that gave it to her came from anywhere other than the birds. The mother birds are entirely unafraid of people and are becoming more and more territorial. They swoop at me when I try to access my apartment. They've even hit me a few times. They will hang out on my door frame. They don't fly away no matter what I do. If they wanted to enter the apartment when I open the door, I would not be able to stop them. Perhaps worst of all, they are so *loud.* From about 2am until sunrise, they ***scream.*** I have no idea why. It keeps me up all night and freaks out my cat. Last night was the worst instance. Between the avian shrieking and my cat running all over and howling, I didn't sleep at all. I'm working a full day on less than a half hour's rest.   I figure the first step is to contact the main office about them. I didn't think too much about moving the nests before the birds came back for the spring, but now that they are there, I don't know what can be done. I'm really afraid that they will just destroy the nests and kill the babies. Can I call animal control or maybe a bird sanctuary and have them safely relocated? Are there laws that would prevent that? As a tenant, am I legally allowed to handle this myself? Any and all advice would be appreciated. I understand and respect if they are protected by wildlife laws. But damn, I need some sleep.	No
115	I am a student in Quebec.  Seven of us are moving in, and only two have signed the lease (as is common). I have not signed the lease.  We get verbal permission from the landlord to move some of our belongings in early. Half the previous tenants have left, so there is space. I moved in early with all my stuff. I sublet from one of the previous tenants, but did not personally get permission from the landlord, but  I find out later that this previous tenant did not tell the landlord.  Five days in, I start getting hundreds of bites on my arms and legs. It turns out that the place is infested by bed bugs, and has been for a while, with 4 ineffective treatments over the past year.  I move out and back to a friend's house, taking only the essentials -- clothes (which I treat in the dryer), and laptop. I leave the rest of my stuff in the house.  I tell the other future tenants, and the landlord calls a meeting -- tells us that the previous tenants are to blame, and that the house will get heat treated in the next week.  Some stuff (aerosols, a violin) cannot withstand heat treatment. I get verbal approval to go into the house and move it out before the exterminator comes.  When I turn up to the house, the landlord is there with the exterminator. The landlord tells us that we are getting steam treatment in just some of the rooms, rather than the heat treatment we were promised.  I argue with them for about 2 hours, and eventually they agree again to heat treatment. The treatment is scheduled for 10 days later.  I go in a week later to move out the aerosol/violin etc. and find that the landlord has thrown away most of my belongings because they were covered in bed bugs.  What are my rights? If I take him to small claims court, am I likely to win?	No
116	"I rent an apartment in Tennessee. My lease is set to end on July 31st, 2017. The leasing office is now requiring that all residents be moved out by 9 am on the 31st, or face an additional fine. Is that allowed? Because my lease just says ""until July 31st 2017"""	No
117	Hi everyone, hope I'm posting in the right place  We closed on an older (~35 years) home in early July, so we were expecting some issues. The owners was gracious enough to leave us receipts for some of the work they had done to the home. One of these receipts were for some foundation/crack patchwork they had done in the laundry room and the installation of a sump pump.  We had the home inspected and the inspector didn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary that we couldn’t see with our own eyes. There were some patent defects (i.e visible defects) so we made the informed decision to proceed with the purchase.  Fast forward to when took possession of the home.  We removed the basement carpet and noticed it smelled and there were some wet spots. We figured this was normal with an older home/older carpet so whatever. Then we explored the option of installing a window in the basement, so we took off the drywall and saw a big problem…a large crack in the foundation from top to bottom (where foundation meets the attached garage). When the house was being sown, this room had boxes and furniture in the area of the wall which made it impossible to see or feel the carpet  We called some foundation repair guys to fix the crack, which they did. But in the process, they noticed that the entire weeping tile surrounding the home was clogged with roots, which they said would be the reason the old owners installed the sump pump this past spring (right before they listed the home for sale)  So what was originally a ~$3000 crack repair job has turned into a ~$30,000 crack repair/excavation around the home/waterproof/weeping tile replacement job. They even had to break our garage floor and excavate down to the bottom to replace that piece of the weeping tile system  So, my question is…anyone have success with latent defect lawsuits (Ontario, Canada)? I know “Buyer beware” is at play in all real estate transactions, but with a crack big enough to put my hand in and the fact that they installed a sump pump prior to putting the house on the market leads me to believe they or the plumber or even the real estate agent  knew something was up.  TL;DR…Bought an older home only to discover a cracked foundation and clogged weeping tile system. We’re in for  ~$30,000 worth of repairs so far	No
118	Hi, So I had 8 months left on my lease when I had to move out. The apartments told me after 1 week of moving out the apartment would be ready and that they will try to rent it out ASAP to minimize my losses. After 2 days of signing and paying them the reletting fee, they change the availability of the apartment to 2 weeks. They decide to renovate and increase the rent of the apartment since now is renovated. Before leaving I asked and they told me they will not renovate. I even ask for the price my apartment will be rented and they mention they would not know but it will be most likely cheaper than the other 4 apartments and similar to one since mine was not renovated. Is there anything I can do. Is like they took advantage of me paying already for those 2 weeks.  Second, since it will take them a lot to rent those apartments. Can I just send a friend to do a 1-month lease with them? The apartment price is considerably high when you do 1 month. But I still have 8 left,  and I doubt they will rent the apartment. Would I be still legally bound to pay for the other 7 months?	No
119	Let’s say a person witnesses an occurrence at work, reported it, and subsequently someone lost their job.  The fired employee tried to sue for wrongful dismissal (saying the investigation was botched/incident never happened) and it ended in a settlement.  The license of said fired employee is now going to be revoked under gross misconduct, so there is another hearing.  The incident happened off camera, so it was largely down to sworn witness testimony.   If the fired employee wins, is the witness liable for a lawsuit?  Also, if the witness spoke to other employees to ask for advice on reporting to management, is there any liability there?	No
120	Not sure my state matters,  I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I need advice and feel stupid.   I received my first credit last week.  It's through Capital One. I activated it, set up my account, then used it at the grocery store for $7.  Today I went to pay my electric bill and it was declined.  When I check my online account I see they locked my card due to fraud.   I call Capital One and get directed to their fraud specialist.  Initially she tells me there is no fraud,  the card just isn't activated yet.  She puts me on hold to fix it.  Before this, she verified: My social Phone number Email address Credit card number and crv on the back  When she comes back she informs me she no longer thinks I am who I say am.  She tells me someone else called and asked for a new card to be sent out (somehow verified all the info down to my credit card number??)  So she tells me in order to prove I am who I say I am I need to email them a front and back photo of my drivers license, a front and back photo of my social security card and a photo of a utility bill in my name.   I understand they need to verify me,  but the whole explanation was very sketchy and I'm really nervous to email them all this info.   I could really use some advice please.   Thank you so much.	No
121	"So the 3 unit building I live in was sold, with my existing lease being transferred to the new owner. However, the new LL is looking to renovate the 3 apartments and turn them into top dollar apartments/condos.   The new LL has contacted me to discuss a buyout of my lease. I'm not necessarily happy about the prospects of moving as I love my location and have spent years here, and it's close to work.  All that being said, I don't want to live in a building with 2 apartments above me being gutted and redone, as we are the last tenants remaining in the building. If we could come to an agreement and both sides come away winners, I would be willing to make a deal.   I guess my question for you guys is what is the ""standard"" buyout in a situation like this? I know there is no ""standard"", but I'm looking to at least go into discussions with a ballpark figure and some type of explanation as to how I came up with that figure.  I have just over 24 months remaining on my lease. I live in a 3 Bdrm an expensive part of Boston. Avg 3 Bdrm is around 2800.  Any advice or past experience is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

122	I am 22 years old and mom and I rent a house together with my brother. Both her and I are on the lease. She is angry that I am not attending church and is pulling out all of my belongings to the bedroom and putting it in the garage. She is saying I have to live in the garage from now on and am no longer welcome to live in the house. What she is doing is illegal right?	No
123	Recently I've had a terrible living situation which fell through to me leaving. I signed a contract but I read the fine print front to back, so I know what I got myself in.   It first started with her trying to make me pay bills for the previous tenant, then she was trying to get me to pay a TV bill, even though the contract specifically states 50% gas, electric and internet. It's finally coming to an end but she's trying to nickle and dime any little bit of money she can get out of my deposit she owes me.   I did have a girlfriend stay over for 4 nights. The contract specifically says I can have a person over 1 night a weekend and without written consent then it's a breach of the agreement. She knew my girlfriend was going to be there more times than in the contract, she verbally agreed and I have texts of her basically implying that it's okay for her to stay (I.E. I'm gonna love you AND GF so much, I feel you AND GF will be a breath of fresh air).   I see this as two ways, to argue against that but I don't know if that's enough evidence against her for her to get it, but she was very well aware of my GF being there, and she was very okay with it before this hit the fan. She wants me to pay for the 4 nights gf stayed there, which I guess makes sense in terms of the contract.   But now she doesn't want to meet with me in her apartment until her lawyer is free. I want to call her bluff since this woman is unemployed and from her history of how she sounds I'm catching red flags that she is a pathological liar.   My question is when this all rolls around tomorrow, how do I keep my cool when I'm being pressured by her and her (possibly fake) lawyer, and how can I break it down to them that I'm not finagling anything for myself? Also any way for me to see if the guy is a licensed state lawyer? Badge that he might carry, something only a real lawyer can have in their possession?	No
124	"Hi folks,  I was excited to see that Ryuichi Sakamoto is having a short film contest where you make a short film that utilizes songs from his new album, and three winners get money, compositions to use in future films, filmmaking advisor services, a spot on the blu-ray version of the album, among other things.

125	"I'm speaking on behalf of my parents. These past 2 months have been very unfortunate financially. So this is what happened.. (My dad is a trucker) Yesterday my dad was unloading on a companies lot during the day. Just in front of the company the other lot is owned by a restaurant. Later that night after unloading, around 8:00-9:00PM my dad got tired and moved his truck ONTO the other lot (restaurants property) to rest a little bit. The truck was still running, my dad was in the truck. The only sign that was there was ""no overnight parking"" which I'm assuming is after 12 not before. They locked up one of his wheel before coming up and banging on his door to talk. Apparently they didn't have any ID's or anything. My dad called the police and the police couldn't do anything about it. Apparently towing companies in Charlotte won the bill where it seems like they can give a ticket for any amount they want. Seems very unregulated to me. This price is very hefty on my parents and they had to pay with credit. Is there anything we can do? My parents called their lawyer and the price added up to 200$ +200/h. They don't think it's worth it. Help would be much appreciated!"	No
126	Hi /r/legaladvice Partner and I are looking at settling for a brand new place tomorrow. Unfortunately it is not ready to live in with a number of issues that still require a clean up. The vendors (also the builders) have stated they will fix it up when they return from their holiday on the 22/7. I have this in writing via email. Would it still be advisable to withhold an amount of settlement? Is there any legal obligation for them to make sure everything is fixed up? My solicitor had informed me that if I trust the vendor I can let it be sorted out. I was also informed that I may request for them to pay the necessary costs for me to fix up the property, if this has not been completed within the defect rectification period.	No
127	I've resided in California for the last year and I need a dime of advice, PLEASE! I am well aware of the power of contracts and this one was all jacked up. Now in September my lease will end, but I want to renew it, why else would I pay raised rent for 2 months (minor adjustments higher for 'rent control').   Here is where I'm stuck; Will renewing the lease lock in my rent? I'm afraid if I ride along a month to month deal, they are definitely going to raise costs, I believe unreasonably too (they have lawyers on it, I'm sure). They know the Cost of Living in CA is always climbing. Please give me your best take. Maybe somebody who specializes in contract law.   Also, the signed copy of my contract was jacked because instead of terminating 2017, it says it terminated the day I signed 2016 (I don't know how I missed it). Anyways, what can you tell me, PLEASE help me make an informed decision.	No
128	"Hello friends,  So I am in quite the predicament and needing some help from reddit!  This is a throwaway account as the person discussed is also a regular visitor.  My fiance and I recently found out that we are moving due to a job I received.    Background: We are both currently living in an apartment near her mother.  About 1.5 years ago, her mother helped her find an apartment and purchased several pieces of furniture to help her furnish the new place.  Her mother obviously not on the lease nor has keys.   Fast-forward to today: Her mother is demanding that she give back all the things that she ""loaned"" to her to furnish the apartment.  She is obviously upset that we are moving away and is trying to do anything to force us to stay nearby.  She has threatened to take us to court for ""her"" belongings.  Are we obligated to give back every item her mother purchased for the apartment?  This includes: a futon, bed frame, kitchen table, bar stools, and entertainment center.  Thanks again everyone for all your help."	No
129	My sister and her husband are getting a divorce and he told her he enrolled their kids in public school and will be sending the orders in the mail. Right now they home school and the kids are VERY smart. She fulfills all the state requirements and they score very well on the standardized tests. Also neither of their work schedules would work very well with dropping them off and picking them up. He was the big proponent of homeschooling and is just doing this to be a jerk.   He has an attorney but my sister can't afford one. She has tried calling the number for free legal advice but hasn't been able to get through. The hours they are open are limited. I could help pay if an attorney would take monthly payments and wouldn't be horribly expensive.    Can he even do this without her permission? What can she do? She already filed for divorce but I guess the next step in the process (court date?) isn't until September. School starts in August. My sister is trying to be agreeable and wants joint custody. We don't know what he's even after.   I know there may be negative comments on homeschooling but it has nothing to do with me and wouldn't be very helpful. Oh also we are in Washington state. Thank you in advance for your help!! I will be at work so probably can't respond.	No
130	Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	No

I've worked at many bars and restaurants over the years and I've never had to sign anything like this before, and I'm just wondering what other folks might think before I sign the contract.   The things that stood out to me were: - ""Probation: The first six months of employment are a probationary period during which Employer may, in its sole discretion and for any reason, terminate employment without further compensation, notice, pay in lieu of notice, and severance"".

132	We moved into the apartment in April, 12 month lease.  Several weeks ago we noticed evidence of mice in one of out bathrooms.  We thoroughly cleaned the droppings, notified the property manager, and 3-4 days later an exterminator came and sealed the holes in the wall where the mice were getting in.  Last week, we noticed new evidence of mice in our kitchen.  We notified the property manager again, and they came out and did a more thorough inspection to find that mice are chewing holes in our kitchen, both bathrooms, and the bedroom where our 2 year old sleeps.  We want to break the lease, the complex wants us to give 60 days notice and pay an additional 2 months after we move out.  Even if they fill all these holes, the building has a larger mouse problem and the rodents problem will persist.    I am arguing that they did not comply with the NC General Statute 42-42: Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.  There is also an 'imminent danger' clause that specifies a rat infestation, but nothing about mice.    We keep the apartment clean, never any food or dirty dishes left out.     Will this evidence be sufficient that the apartment is not inhabitable? The complex has offered us the buyout, which is our lease goes 60 days from the date we sign, and we pay a buyout fee of 2 months rent, so we effectively pay for 4 months that we are not living there.  Should I sign the notice to move out they provided?  Can we just move out and not pay anything?  I have reached out to the city housing department to see if they think this situation is 'uninhabitable'.    Thanks for any advice!	No
133	"I recently moved into a new apartment complex in a Houston, TX.   After touring the building with the leasing agent my gf and I asked every single question we could think of including several specific, easy to understand questions about the freight train lines that run close to the property.   I asked if there was a schedule the trains operated on, when the peak traffic hours were, and, most importantly, if the trains used the tracks and blew their extremely loud horns at night. The agent told me several times that train traffic was limited to, ""one or two in the morning and in the evening"". She assured me I would be able to get a peaceful nights rest. I thought I had done my due diligence. I was happy to be adulting.    I needed a place quickly so I reserved a unit and signed a lease a few weeks later.   Move in day rolls around and we get everything unpacked and put away like pros in less than 8 hours. During that time there had been a few trains (maybe 3 or 4) that had gone by and sounded their horns. It startled us at first but we were ok with it because we would be at work for a majority of the day.  That first night and every night since has been hell. We quickly discovered that the most active traffic hours for the train lines are from 1-6 in the morning. The trains blast their horns according to the Train Horn Rule: locomotive engineers must begin to sound train horns at least 15 seconds, and no more than 20 seconds, in advance of all public grade crossings. What was a loud but acceptable noise during the day turned into an impossibly loud blast of sound that has woken us up every single time a train goes by. One night I counted 15 trains between 1 and 6 am.   Is there anything I can do to get out of here? I spoke with the property manager the morning after moving in and she basically told me the agent I dealt with would never have said anything like that and I would be responsible for the full term of the lease were I to move out. I wouldn't have signed the lease had she truthfully disclosed the information I requested of her.   It's been about a week and a half since I moved in and I have been trying to get used to it. I'm a heavy sleeper and have lived near noisy things before. Believe me when I tell you the decibel level in my unit must be north of 85-90 each time these trains blow their horns. I haven't gotten any sleep since I've been here.   This is my first apartment out of college and I work close to 70 hours a week. I need a place where I can sleep. Any thoughts would be appreciated."

134	Like the title states a friend and I have come up with a fun little idea and we want to build it and try market it. It would be named after a video-game character.  Any advice on whether or not this would be legal? Or any good resources on where to see if the name is still trademarked?  Thank you in advance!	No
135	Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	No
136	My fiance's mother is willing to sell is her house for what she owes on it. It'd be a great opportunity to have instant equity for remodeling. We would be first time home buyers.  What is the best way to go about this? I've seen several ways online but not sure what the best way is. I've seen situations where we could buy the home for $100k but pay property taxes on the homes value (350k). The numbers are made up but kind of similar.   Any advice would be great!	No
137	My uncle was a landscaper. He was working for someone that owns a family business company. They were working on a  yard and he needed to get something from the back of the truck. While he was standing behind the parked truck someone under the influence drove by and struck him . That was at 2pm yesterday. He was pronounced dead at the hospital around 3pm that day. His wife and children are obviously distraught. The man that hit him has prior d.u.i convictions. A couple of months ago my dad (his brother) passed away. My uncle was generous enough to help put in thousands for my dads funeral but with doing that his family is left with little to no money for my uncles funeral and other expenses. If the guy driving doesn't have a legal license or isn't insured are they at a loss? Is there any legal action they should try to take?	No
138	My apartment and the rest in the building specifies that tenants may not allow smoking on premises.  Typically, how should this be interpreted? Is the premises the interior or does it include the balcony? Does it also include the common areas?  Also, what can I do as a tenant if a landlord won't enforce this? I've read that breathing problems MIGHT be considered a disability that he would have to accommodate, but is not smoking near my front door or within however many feet of my balcony even a reasonable accommodation to request? And if another tenant is already not following the rules and is smoking inside, would getting proof of a need for accommodation from my doctor even be worthwhile? (Meaning, can he be required to take steps to actually enforce policy or just have the policy? Such as eviction.)  Thanks in advance!	No
139	Hi, I'm 17m working at a fast food chain in CT. My boss is taking hours from myself and the other workers. He's done this before, I had my hours written down and he told me that I changed them to give me more hours. Last time he did this, he shorted me by about 14 hours. Well now I have my printed receipts for the hours that I worked. He told one of my co workers that the hours I stayed late with her, because it was busy, I won't get paid for.(to clarify this is maybe an hour once or twice a week) I get paid on Tuesday.  My questions are, if my hours don't match up, what should I do to get them back? Can I sue him over this? What about my co workers, they don't have any evidence that they worked more than he has said, can they get any hours back?	No

141	"Hey friends, would love the community's thoughts on my situation.   I own and operate an ecommerce store. We're currently talking to a well-known artist about licensing his work to use on our merchandise.   The artist's licensing people have asked for a proposed royalty, advance, and guarantee. I'm trying to calculate these figures in a way that makes sense. In the last 30 days, our top 400 products generated a total of $1900 in sales per product (over $20k annualized). We plan on licensing over 500 designs from the artist. What sort of calculation needs to happen here?   My understanding is that a royalty of about 15% is appropriate give the fame of the artist and the fact that I operate a sort of ""specialty shop."" I've heard a $25k advance for an artist's catalog makes sense. But what about the guarantee?   We only have an online presence (only retail, no wholesale).   Does anyone have any experience in this area? Many thanks in advance."	No
142	"Rented a sublet ""basement"" apartment. The LL is 83 yrs old, 10 properties. Was advertised as a single room sublet. 3 bedrooms in total. One woman (we'll call her J) was living before me on a month to month basis. The ""lease"" is month to month, but it has all 3 of our names on it when I moved in, and they wanted a single payment of the total rent, not individual payments. My friend (call him F) and I (call me Q) took the two available rooms. We paid security and first month's rent May 1 17. Each paid rent through July separately.   It then came to our attention that the unit is illegal. We have serious bug issues, a gas stove, no egress, windows are too small, no ventilation, a ""bathroom"" which is just a sink and a toilet in the hallway, and the place is without a doubt more than 50% underground. **This is definitely a cellar, not a basement.**   I did research and am aware that he is in violation of his mortgage, insurance, DoB, FDNY, and the list goes on. I threatened him with the release of this information to these authorities, plus a civil suit for damages, if he does not pay me (Q) and my friend (F) $4,000 each for the return of our rent ($3k) plus relocation costs.   Within 48 hours of our demand, we received a letter from his lawyer agreeing to pay us $8000 in total for the three of us to 1. vacate the premises upon payment (and sweep??) and 2. vacate by Aug 21.   The issue is that when I demanded the money I made it clear this was for was for **F and Q, $4k each**. J is on her own. The settlement letter given to us is $8000 for F, Q, J. **J never wanted to be involved in this**. The LL has continued to treat the three of us as a single family unit.   J is an IDIOT and wants to stay. She believes she will be able to stay, which I have stressed that she probably won't. We don't want her on this settlement.  I want to amend 3 things with this settlement:   1. I want J crossed out. The agreement we proposed was between F and Q only. J is on her own, she wants to stay and that's between her and the LL as far as I'm concerned. F and Q want OUT.  2. We want the date to be changed to Aug 31 so we can actually find a place given short notice.   3. We want to amend the amount to at least $10,000 between F and Q.  The old man probably shit himself after I spoke to him...they got back to us within 48 hours of our demands. His lawyer probably told him to pay the money and pray we don't ask for more. We are really in a position of strength here.   How high can we amend the settlement amount between F and Q? Don't want to be greedy, but since he was so quick to bend over for $8k (combined), we should absolutely push for $10-15k, maybe even more.  J feels like she's been fucked over and is being forced on the street. I don't really care. She didn't take the offer of being included in the settlement. She was warned that she's not allowed to live here.   TLDR: LL gave us illegal unit. Me and friend asked for settlement. LL added third person to settlement. We want to remove third person and increase as much as possible.  Your help is much appreciated. Thanks!"	No
143	I moved into my new apartment on Monday (the 24th). I finished moving the last of my things out and cleaning my old apartment on Tuesday and went to turn in my keys. The landlord wasn't there, but since it was about 1600 I figured she left a little early, since the office runs on normal business hours, M-F 8-5. I usually work those hours so my time to stop by is very limited. Wednesday I actually had to go in at 1100 instead, so I stopped by about 1000 and she still wasn't there. I tried to call, but no answer, so I just went to work. Yesterday I was off, so I stopped by around 1200, she still wasn't there, and there was a note from another tenant put into the door between it and the doorframe. Went home, did some things, stopped by again around 1500 and the note was still there, meaning she had not gone in. Tried to make a call, no answer. Stopped by again at 1630, note still there, phone call went straight to voicemail. I'm currently on my lunch break, went to stop by again, not there no answer on phone.   My lease ends on the 31st and my question is what legal trouble could I get in if I still haven't been able to turn in my keys by then? What actions can I take on the 31st before any legal actions are taken against me?	No
144	Hello!   I'm a foreign student in the US; I'm on a student visa (F-1) going to art school. I know I can't work/get paid here legally, but can I make a film (me as writer/director) if I don't get paid at all? I will gather producers and crew, and they will get paid with money we raise to make the film, but I won't. Is that legal? I plan on sending the film to festivals in the US and abroad, if that makes a difference.   I went to film school here a couple of years ago and made some short films then, but I don't know if it's different now because my major (fine arts) is different...    Thank you!	No
145	Might be a dumb question, this is my first apartment. When our original lease ended we agreed with our landlord to keep living here and paying month-to-month the same amount. Our AC is out and since we are not currently on a lease does the landlord have any obligation to pay for it? He hasn't in the past since the lease ended.	No
146	I have never liked my first name and recently I have undergone some emotional trauma related to it, so I want to legally continue using my second name instead. I'm a 23 year old senior college student and I would like to know what would be the legal repercussions and what I should start to do in order to stick to this identity. I have read about some people being able to do this without changing their name but I fear that I might do something wrong in the process. I will greatly appreciate any and all feedback.	No
147	Hello everyone,  I am moving into my first apartment this fall near my University.  I signed a lease for a two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend last November.  On the lease it says that we can move in on August 19th.  Every other apartment complex we've heard of in this town, including his current apartment, ends their lease on July 31st and begins the following year's lease on August 1st.  This lease has us move in on August 19th and move out on July 31st.  While this is frustrating because he is without an apartment for the first part of August, we understand that we screwed up and signed for a later date.  The landlord wants the cost of an entire month, $569, due on August 1st even though we are only allowed to begin moving in on the 19th.  We have asked them to move in earlier since we are already paying the cost of a month and nobody will be in the apartment, but they have said no.  My parents think this is illegal.  Is it actually illegal?  This is in Iowa. Thank you!	No
148	My ex and I agreed that we would pay our fair share of taxes, in proportion to our earnings, at tax time. Because I withheld too much, and she withheld too little, I ended up paying her taxes for her. Per our divorce agreement, in this situation we agreed to pay back the other, but she is now refusing to pay. Do I have to go to divorce court, or could I take her to civil court, or even small claims court, to get my money?	No
149	"Context I got a really bad tattoo cover-up from one of the artists at this shop. Which is both unfortunate and confusing because she's done 2 other tattoos for me and did an amazing job. I'm glad I stopped her from finishing the shit show while I had the chance.   Now begins the task of finding someone to cover it up. This was going to be more difficult than I imagined. The artists I've contacted either want nothing to do with it, ignore me, or tell me they may be able to cover it up using a dragon or a snake. I've learned that my options are limited, and finding someone to collaborate a working design with is becoming less and less hopeful. I had one artist suggest tentacles, and when I asked if he had any other ideas he was offended and began preaching about ""how I'm the type of guy that needs everything in writing"" and emailed me later saying that ""He'd have to pass on the project"". The tattoo is so dark that another very reputable shop I contacted to cover it up said they could help me if I do tattoo laser removal to lighten it up as much as possible. Sounds like fun. No. $300 dollars and two excruciatingly painful sessions later, I saw zero results. Even the bits of the faded original tattoo you could see underneath showed no improvements. The nice lady that owns and operates the tattoo removal studio told me it could take up to 12 sessions to remove. I'm not willing to dump another $900+ and subject myself to more painful treatments on a gamble.  So I decide to try my luck again with a cover up and just black it out with a design. I've been told something organic like feathers works well for cover ups so I found some splatter like crow designs online and figured it would be dark enough to cover everything up. The same tattoo shop I got the bad cover up at has an artist named Thor there that does some really beautiful work. He's done two other smaller projects for me and he's a really nice guy, or so I thought. Now I know what you're thinking. ""Why the fuck would you go back to the same shop after the first bad tattoo? Don't you know how to learn lessons, stupid""?  Well hypothetical asshole, one of the artists there is actually a good friend of my girlfriends, and he suggested I talk to this Thor guy about covering it up for me. I call him, and he asks me to come in so he can take a look at it. I go in. His facial expression is concerning but he seems optimistic. He asks for a $60 deposit and we schedule a time for me to come in at 5 the following Monday. Thor requests some pictures for reference so he can draw a design around the dumpster fire tattoo, and that he'll send me what he comes up with so we can collaborate a design that will work and that I'll like. Sounds fucking great right? No. I finished work early that Monday and sent him a text telling him I could come early if he wasn't busy. He responds ""Nah bro"", and ""Actually if you wouldn't mind showing up about an hour later so at 6pm or so I just got a flat so I'm running late"". Sounds reasonable. Shit happens. Eventually, he tells me ""Actually I don't think that's gonna work I still have to do my first appointment before I can get yours"". So we reschedule for the following Friday at 12 when they open.  Friday couldn't come soon enough. I was really excited to get this butt butter of a tattoo covered up. Again. I had work but I busted my ass to get it done, commuted over an hour from the last customers location, bought water (over 105 degrees outside and I was on a motorcycle), paid for 2 hours of parking, and was on his shops doorstep by 11:55. Waiting on the bench, I watched the clock pass 12. I knock. No answer. So I send a text. To my extreme disappointment, but honestly not surprised because this fucking tattoo has cursed me, he responds ""I'm sorry bro I'm not going to be able to make it till 5 today"". Are you serious? I'm here and already paid for 2 hours of parking and have taken off work resulting in a loss of wages (Piece work pay). At this point I've lost trust and all faith in this tattoo shop. So I texted him back ""I'll come pick up my deposit later."" He responds ""Can't do that bro"", and my blood starts to boil. I say ""Whys that"", and he says ""Deposits are non refundable"". He never said anything about this and I didn't sign anything acknowledging it either. So I tell him ""I can take you to small claims court if you like"", and he responds ""Or you can be a man and just get your tattoo"". I can be a man really? Wouldn't a ""man"" be someone who shows up to his obligations? Wouldn't a ""man"" tell a paying customer before his appointment starts he's not going to make it? Wouldn't a ""man"" give someone their money back if they weren't happy with their services especially if he hasn't done any work for it? So, trying really hard to keep my composure, I respond ""I'm sitting outside your building right now. You steal clients money and then insult them. Not smart. I'll see you in court"". After that I get a steady stream of messages. He tells me ""sometimes shit happens"", and ""if you can't be a little patient and accept the situation for what it is then Unfortunately I'm sorry what else can I say"". He goes on to say ""You don't get your deposit back because that deposit goes towards research and development as well as the stencil has already been madeyou"". Fair enough. Except he never made the stencil. I texted him about it several times and he never answered. So I called and got him on the phone. He sounds annoyed. He tells me ""I'm still working on it, it will be finished when you come in"". Bullshit. He was going to draw it on the spot like every other tattoo I've ever gotten. Not to mention I was the one that did the ""research and development"" for him when I texted him 8 examples of what I was hoping to get done over a week prior. He continues, ""I didn't become one of the most respected tattoo artists in Tucson by stealing my clients money that's not the business I'm in"", and ""you've already had problems with other artists at my shop your patronage has been more of a hassle than anything so if you want to start throwing threats about small claims court I have to ask you to please not ever step foot in our shop again and I'll see you in court"". So now I guess the bad cover up I got from one of their other artists was my fault. Sorry to hassle you by coming back to the same shop that fucked up my arm and give you a paid opportunity to do the right thing. What I came to realize after this whole fiasco was the fact that he never intended to do the tattoo in the first place. I know this because the guy that's friends with my girlfriend that works at the shop told us ""He does that all the time. He's done it to my friends and it pisses me off"". I can't blame him for referring me to Thor. Thor does great work, and like I said, he seemed like a nice guy.   Shower Thoughts On a more personal note, this entire tattoo mess has been exhausting. I've been trying to find a solution for covering it up since the day I first got the damn thing almost a year ago. It's embarrassing to show and people constantly ask me the five WTF W's about it. This whole situation gives me anxiety, and all I want is to get it covered up. I just want a professional that takes pride in his craft and treats his clients with respect. For that I would gladly pay whatever the cost. It's been difficult to find someone with these qualities in my area. In my experiences they're disrespectful, narcissistic, and rudely opinionated. They act like they're doing you a favor for giving them your business. It doesn't help that most of these artists talk shit about one another and their clients as soon as they leave the building. The girl that did the 2 out of 3 good tattoos for me left the shop she was at before because she got tired of all the shit talking. It seems they all know each other, and it feels an awful lot like I'm walking through the fucking halls of my middle school again. I don't care about your drama, I'm just here for a tattoo.  Legal Questions Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant. Long story short is this worth taking to court? An attorney I contacted instructed me to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals Consumer Complaints Division. Small claims clerk told me that I need to find the tattoo parlors statutory agent to serve the papers too. The problem is he isn't an owner there, and I don't have his personal contact information. I think tattoo artists are like barbers where they pay rent for the chair they use. You can pay for this information. You have to pay a fee to process the claim. You have to pay someone to serve the papers to him. And then there's even more wages lost going to court. It doesn't seem worth it but from what I've learned of this guy he does it to people all the time and it's not right. There's more to running a business than the quality of your craft. I just want my deposit back. What should I do?"	No
150	"Hello,      My GF could really use any advice available because she is in a crappy situation with her roomates. All of them are signed as co-tenants on a month to month lease. But the other couple had recently broken up and both wanted out. They never were going to tell my GF but she found new apartment applications on the dining room table and then asked them about it. Thats how she found out about everything. That was only a month ago, and both of them have already removed the majority of their stuff from the apartment, besides their cat, who has caused a lot of damage to the apartment and is being neglected. Last night one of them tried to move in a new girl to take their place but she has not even filled out an application and is not on the lease. My GF told her roommate that before she can move anybody in, it needs to be approved by the property manager first. Her roomate responded by saying ""i'm still moving her in if you want the bills paid"". We have this text screenshotted because shes threatening to not pay this months rent (even though she has been staying there and has not taken her cat yet) and to move somebody in without signing the lease first. Also, we were told by the assistant property manager that they were never even notified of the cat being in the apartment, meaning that she lied to my GF about having their permission. We have many photos of the cat, her admitting that the cat caused the damage, her saying that she ran it by the property manager (she didn't), and an ad that she put out on craigslist that was dated august 1, meaning she didnt start looking for a roomate until this month. My gf has given a 60 day notice and wants the three of them to split the remaining balance due so they can all be done with it. But the other girl is refusing and the bill is overdue. My gf does not want to live with a stranger, she does not want to stay there anymore, and she has not had the time to move out her belongings even though her current roomate is pressuring her into moving im a complete stranger by saturday. The property manager said a couple days ago that they can still perform a roomate swap, allow the new girl to move in, and release my gf from the lease, but the new person would be solely responsible for the rent and need to fill out an application first. But her current roomates still have not fixed the carpet that their cat ruined. What are my GF's options? Is there anything she can do? We have been documenting every little thing and have copys of the lease and monthly payments. She's also trying to pressure my gf into finding a new roomate to take her place, but thats not her responsibility, she just wants out. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	No
151	I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	No
152	Stockton - California (USA)  Let me just get to the core of the situation. My friend and her husband are sharing an apartment with her husbands Mother and Sister. All costs are 50/50. Mother wants to move out with daughter so she went to turn in a thirty day notice with her (mom's) name and daughters name. She was told the notice wasn't valid unless all names are on the notice, so she promptly put the names of my friend and her husband without their consent on the notice. Now the leasing office is refusing to listen them about how the signatures were put on the notice without consent. The leasing office is now refusing to allow my friend and her husband to bring on another qualified tenant to help pay for the apartment even though they wish to resign a lease. What legal actions does my friend and her husband have since the process that started this was void to begin with? The leasing office is refusing their complaints. My guess is because it is due to rent control and by releasing to new tenants they can raise the price.	No
153	"Rental tenancy dispute over flood damages caused by faulty toilet that clogged and overflowed.  A close friend of mine was renting a downtown vancouver high rise apartment. She lost her job 6 months ago and had to move out since she couldn't make rent.   The landlord - a property development company that owns the entire building - told her that she could not break the lease. She looked for subtenants and found one. Subtenant was approved by the landlord.  The subtenant didn't know if she wanted to stay longer than a month.  But after the month, she really liked the place and decided to stay till the end of my friend's lease - which was the end of last month. My friend didn't have this extension approved by the landlord. They thought she was only staying for a month. (More on this later)  Two weeks before the lease came to a close, the toilet had clogged and flooded. Apparently, the subtenant had flushed the toilet and went to bed. But the toilet tank flapper valve was stuck open and by perfect fucking coincidence, managed to also to be clogged on the drain end.  Water flowing in. Water not draining out. The toilet bowl floods all night. Subtenant wakes up next morning and discovers the water under her feet. She starts putting down towels and attempts to unclog the toilet drain.   Neighbors notify the landlord at this point. They walk in with their emergency repair crews and start ripping out the flooring.  The property manger takes down a statement from the subtenant. The subtenant apparently told her that toilet was always faulty. That it had overflowed and flooded twice prior to this incident. But in those cases, she was able to plunge the toilet out and fix the issue herself. So she didn't think it was necessary to notify my friend or the actual landlord. She fixed the issues herself.  My friend and I were on a business trip far away at the time. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a hold of the subtenant. She was notoriously hard to get a hold of even before. She's an international student with some difficulty with English. At this point, she saw the condition of the suite with the floors ripped out and went and stayed in a hotel. That weekend she went back home to Taiwan.  Landlord is now claiming that my friend is reponsible for the entire damage since the flood was caused by the negligence of the subtenant. Since the toilet had clogged twice before, she should have notified either my friend or the landlord directly and made sure that there was nothing wrong with it. The damages are some $60k since the water went 4 stories down. I find this extremely hard to believe since the pictures the landlord showed us as proof very clearly shows the water didn't even go 6 feet outside the bathroom door.  My friend does not have any form of rental insurance. She is not in a great financial position to pay for this claim. She's a wreck at the moment. She has been living at home the last 6 months with her parents. Her dad is the guarantor on her lease. And now she's terrified that the landlord would go after her dad and force a sale on their house. They're not financially well off either, with major credit lines already racked up. So she's not in a productive state of mind at the moment. I am helping her out by scheduling meetings with lawyers etc.  So far, we've met 3 lawyers. Each have their own position on this.   Lawyer #1: The least sharp professional I've come across. I genuinely thought she was hungover when she met us. She kept insisting that 11:57 AM - which is when the emergency repair crews went into the apartment was in the middle of the night and not almost noon. Even after I pointed this out, she kept saying that no reasonable person would expect the subtenant to be awake ""so late in the night."" She said we had a 50-50 chance nevertheless. She wasn't clear on what is expected from a reasonable person in this situation. Buying a plunger and fixing the clogs herself is not enough to be not negligent? Or was her responsibility very clearly to notify the landlord about this issue that she already fixed herself?  Lawyer #2: He was super-optimistic. We walked out of there and my friend actually was happy enough to respond to a high-5 I gave her. He said we're going to delegate responsibility for this damage on to the subtenant. Since she is in Taiwan now, the landlord will have a hard time going after her. What we needed to prove was that the landlord understood and knew very well that the subtenant was executing the remainder of the lease and not my friend. Unfortuntely, the landlord explicitly stated in an email that when the walked in to do emergency repairs, they had no idea who the person living there was. Later, she responded by saying that she was the subtenant they had approved 6 months ago. But they had only approved her sublease for 1 month as part of her original plan. True. My friend failed to inform the landlord that the subtenant wanted to extend.  What would it take to delegate responsibility towards the subtenant? How can my friend walk away from this and point the finger at this subtenant? I am not sure if it's that feasible. Moreover, I think this lawyer was trying to make a quick sale and lock in the retainer (We paid him at the end of the consult for the retainer). He was super confident that we were going to win. He later emails us asking for basic things like the tenancy agreement. So not inspiring confidence here.  Lawyer #3: This was probably the only person we met who was telling us the full truth as it is. He straight up said we were going to lose on the negligence part. It will be found that the subtenant was indeed negligent. He suggested we ask the landlord for proof that the damages were actually the amounts they claim they are. I suggested the idea of offloading responsibility on the subtenant. He said that wouldn't go so well simply because the plaintiffs already know she's gone home to Taiwan and it would be very hard to get a hold of her, especially not worth it for this sum of money. Makes perfect sense. Why would they not fight with all they have to make sure the cross-hairs are on my friend and her dad.  This happened today. Confused on who to go with. Never hired lawyers before. L3 is expensive. I felt he was too professional and that he would only stick to the absolute proper and morally correct ways of doing things. L2 seemed like he was a conman trying to convince us that we would win easily. Could it be he can play his charm trick on the judge as well and it would work? He is talking about filing a harassement suit against the landlord's lawyer who is calling my friends dad pretty much every day now. If we are going to be found responsible for this if it goes to trial - maybe the strategy we need to apply would be to roadblock them on every single step of the way and make their lives as hard as possible so they won't even go through the effort?   L1 was garbage.   L2 is super sharp and honestly an extremely effective salesman. He is incredibly effective at producing convincing arguments. And not without supporting evidence and case citations, etc. L2 is young, inexperienced (2 years) and works for a no-name law firm in the middle of nowhere.  L3 is very straightforward and honest. I don't know if he is going to exhaust every possible loophole and sink to the level of doing whatever it takes (as long as it is legal, I dont care about morality or appearing to be an asshole). I didn't get the feeling that he is ready to do this. But he's more experienced in litigation cases. He is also part of a prestigious law firm in the region.  Any obvious things I am missing here? Any obvious choice?  There is a 3rd option. The landlord's lawyer spoke to me over the phone. He wanted to get a hold of my friend's dad. But I picked up and blocked it. He did mention that he wanted to see if there was a way to resolve this issue ""in good faith"" instead of resorting to measures that are irreversible. While I am not on the lease or related to my friend, I do have a substantial savings accumulated up over the years. Maybe just calling this lawyer who wants to talk and having a conversation with him directly would help resolve this quickly? My friend, her mom and her dad are all terrified and simply unable to be productive in any capacity since there is the real threat that their house is going away on top of their already exising problem of criping debt.   They want ~$60k for all sort of damage to the suite and to 10 other suites across 4 stories. Most of that is inflated bullshit, I am convinced. They've never provided an invoice or any sort of evidence of substantial damage in the emails. Would there be a reason why they would have all this evidence and not show it up front when they make their claims? My gut feel tells me if I personally write them a cheque for $15k, I can tell them to fuck off forever. Plausible or am I on crack?  Need some advice. Apologies if this is a giant wall of text."	No
154	"Hey, Guys! It's my first time posting here but I've been a long time lurker of this Sub.  I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do here so I figured I would ask.. Back in mid June my fiancé and I went to see a movie at the local theater. We were leaving and back on the main road that has a few exits onto a main highway. It was very busy and the traffic was stop and go. While trying to change lanes into the lane to our left the traffic again paused very quickly and we hit the back of the car in front of us. It was a low speed collision and there was absolutely no damage to the other car, not even a dent. We took pictures. We have been in contact with the other drive since and there have been no issues with her car. Our vehicle took some damage but we later found out it was cosmetic only and only because our inner rebar had rusted. The damage was minimal enough that we did not go through our insurance.  Cops were called, everyone gave statements.. As far as car accidents go it was pleasant. I was not driving (I currently have an injury that prevents me from doing so but didn't drive previously either). My fiancé was. He has been driving for over 10 years and had never been in an accident before. This was his first. We get a ticket to appear in court.  We get there at the court date and are given a packet of info pertaining to the case. Included is the full police report as well as a plea deal. His plea deal was for a $85 fine and 2 demerit points. We were shocked... Both of us had assumed it would be a fine only. We considered taking the plea but then started looking through the report. The summery that the Cops wrote does not match what actually happened at all, nor does it match the statements from either of us or the other driver.  In the report it states that we were turning onto the road we were already on from a completely different road and literally turned into her from there. This sounds much worse than what actually took place and there is a diagram to match this false account. At the court was the first time we had seen this report. It also states that the other car had a dent and took damage which is untrue and we have pictures to prove that. I am able to take pictures of this if it would help for advice on here.  I'm at a loss. When we got to the judge he tried to explain that the report wasn't correct but all we got was a new date to appear, which is this coming Wednesday. This is new territory for both of us and I'm not sure what to do next or what he may need to say to get this dealt with. The original plea is still on the table. The technical charge is ""Changing Lanes Not in Safety"". There was a woman ahead of us in court who was there for ""Wreckless Driving"" which originally held a charge of 6 demerit points and her plea was for 2 and a fine.  Neither of us think his plea accurately reflects the accident. We're just really shocked at how all of this went down considering he has such a clean record (like, not even a speeding ticket!).  Really, we just need advice on how to move forward. Thanks in advance. :)"	No
155	"My sister's husband received his fifth DUI about a month ago while working out of town in Wisconsin. The court has ruled that he has to return to WI to serve time in September for six months to a year. This is his second time in jail and it has left him bitter and unpredictable towards my sister.  Last Friday night, he took the two kids to his parents house and refused to return them. He told my sister she could not have them and would not give her the gate code. She ended up calling the police and they told her since they were not separated, they could not bring the children back. This was the first time she ever called them because she feared that he  was lying and attempting to run off with them. When she let them know that he was an alcoholic about to go to jail, they told her they would investigate and if he had alcohol on him then they would call CPS to bring the kids back. Except, the police told him they were coming to check on him so he and his family hid any alcohol before they got there. The next day when he finally came back with the children, the oldest told my sister that his father had been drunk all night. He and his family claims my sister is ""crazy"" and that the police agreed. Now we fear that if the police truly said that then we have no help.  His actions make me fearful for the kids. There was a time once when he was caught trying to put one of the children in the backseat of  car while he was intoxicated. My sister caught him and stopped it. Though once they are separated and she's not there to monitor him, I'm afraid he'll do it again.  Now my sister refuses to leave because she wants to keep the house (even though I doubt she'll be able to pay for it with him gone). Does she have any rights to kick him out or keep the house while he's in jail? She is already filing for separation. The house is in a loan under his name but her name is also on the deed. What are her options for the next year as far as establishing custody and child support? I know documenting everything is an option. I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything else I should know."	No

158	Hi guys. First time poster here. Family bought a house about 10 years ago. HOA have been hounding my parents for the previous owner's unpayed HOA fees. They are billing them more than 5,000 . Threatening to put a lean on the house. My family has been paying the HOA fees ever since we moved in to this house. They have tried to settle this long term ago, but management keeps changing and they are very untimely or never reply back. What are my recourses? What documents do I need? . I need to help them. I feel like we are being taken advantage of.	No
159	I got divorced in 2003 and I was on permanent disability. Since I first started getting disability, my wife was in control of the money due to my brain injury/mental disability. To this day, she still has full control over it. I am asking for advice on how to get it out of her name and either back into my name or another family member.  I don't know the exact amount I should be receiving, but i know that she keeps about half of the total amount. The only other source of income I have is 600$ that I receive from the insurance settlement that caused by brain injury.  She says I would probably lose the disability entirely if the disability was taken out of her name or if the bank account it's deposited into changes.   Location: Florida, Hillsborough County	No
160	Posted in r/personalfinance originally   Not sure if best place to post, but have found help on this sub-Reddit before   My grandfather passed away this weekend and I have been off work since. My partner went to work on Monday but came home early and has since taken Tuesday and Wednesday off as well. Partially as she is upset and partially to support me.  Now, the thing is she has been temping at a company the past few weeks (in the uk) and she has been called this morning to be told she is no longer wanted as she is 'unreliable'   To me this seems wholly unfair, as she is taking compassionate leave, and if she had been asked to go in, she would have.  My question is, is this right? Is there anything that can be done here?	No

162	A couple of months ago I noticed the carpet in one of my two bedrooms was wet. Upon further inspection, I saw black mold lining the corner of the carpet in the surronding area. I called my apartment complex's reality company that handles all issues and had to leave a message. In the meantime more and more area in the room began to have water coming up (with no sign of wall leakage) and the carpet was soaked to the point of squisheness so I used my own carpet cleaner to suck up as much as I could, but it seemed the water would replace itself every time I tried. Within a period of 3 weeks, they had a carpet cleaning company come out twice to remove the water. Both times the water came back. Now we are more than two months from the issue first arrising and it has still not been fixed. I have called multiple times about it, and they give me the run around. At this point, I have not been able to stay in the room for about 2 months and my bed currently resides in my living room. I am getting very impatient waiting for them to fix anything, and now I  am wondering if I'm entitled to some kind of compensation because the room has been unliveable with the smell and mold. I don't know how to go about getting this issue fixed. Please advise!	No
163	The toilet in our rental property overflowed, and caused several thousands dollars damage to the unit below. I was told that our tenant was very reckless and would not open the door to stop the toilet overflowing, even after people were banging on the door for several minutes (until eventually the police arrived). There is a police report which says the toilet overflowed.    We called a plumber to check on the toilet and he stated that there was nothing wrong with the toilet.  Next we tried to file a claim with our insurance (under the liability clause), but it was denied because the insurance company stated that I'm not liable, since the damage was not caused by my negligence. I was told that if my tenant had renter's insurance, their insurance would cover it.     Neither our tenant or the tenant below have renter's insurance. The landlord below is very angry and says that she will sue both me and my tenant in small claims court.    From what I understand since I'm not liable, I do not owe anything to the other landlord but I want to avoid the hassle of going to court, and I offered to pay $1500 as a goodwill gesture. Can this be used against me? (i.e. interpreted as admitting guilt?) Should I not give a check? or should I use any particular verbiage on the notes field?	No
164	I have neighbors who moved into an apartment right next to mine. The entire property is non smoking as outlined in the lease. At first they were smoking on the balcony and I reported it to the apartments but it hasn't stopped. Now they are smoking inside blowing it out of the window as it billows into my apartment. I've notified the apartments on 3 separate occasions and they have talked to the neighbors who claim is wasn't them. (I literally saw them with my own eyes..)  The apartments say with no proof there's not much they can do. I have severe allergies that are exasperated by smoke and this has been a huge problem for me. I keep my windows closed as much as possible but the smoke smell seems to permeate through the vents.  Is the apartment legally responsible to fix this issue since I was promised a non smoking living environment?	No
165	"The company is called inspire3 and is British. On their website they claim they do refunds if you are not satisfied with the product. We have emailed each other. They claim they've paid me back, that i should contact my bank and sent me a ""receipt"". The receipt doesnt have my account or card number on it so my bank doesnt accept this. The company claims this is their official receipt and for ""security seasons"" the account number and so on wont be displayed.   I suspect i have some leverage here because else they wouldn't bother with emailing me back."	No
166	I stopped at a stop sign and checked to see if there was any incoming traffic from the left. After checking, i proceeded to turn right but then I saw a person in front my car, crossing the street. So I quickly pulled over my brake and the person saw me coming at her and she quickly back paddled. Then she walked over to the driver's seat and when I pulled over my window to ask if she was alright, she said she WASN'T alright and asked for my information. So i gave her my phone number and my name and she just walked away after verifying my phone number... She was not on the ground, and from my perspective at the time, the only contact that my car had with her was with her hand at the front hood of my car trying to maybe.. prevent the car from lunging at her?   Is there any charges that I can get from this incident?  I am residing in Washington State.	No
167	"Okay, parents got divorced 7 years ago. Both have since remarried. I am their eldest child at 26; my youngest sister is 16.   Technically my parents split custody, with my mom as primary. My father (we do not speak; he blames me for the divorce) sees my sister maybe a weekend every other month despite my mother making her available.   So, onto questions. My father is moving to reopen the divorce, I am guessing to renegotiate my sister's custody and child support. He has never followed the parenting plan, stopped working full time in order to pay almost no child support (while living off his trust), and is now claiming that my mother is not communicating with him/keeping my sister from him. My mother has piles of emails to prove otherwise.   He has threatened to bankrupt her with court proceedings in the past. Is there a point at which  him repeatedly dragging her into court for non-issues or just made up ones becomes a legal issue?   He is also extremely likely to push for my sister (who has her license) to begin to do the 3 hour drives to and from his house, in order to make it more ""fair"". My sister has a restricted license as she has a medical condition that is well controlled but she still has occasional issues; currently he and my mother meet halfway for pickups and drop offs. This will be thrown out, right?  And at what point is my sister able to say ""I really don't actually want to visit dad and Stepbitch""?  And what does ""reopening the divorce"" actually mean?  Also his lawyer is openly bitchy, unprofessional and rude in emails to my mom and her lawyer. Can she be reported for this?  TL;DR: Dad is asshole who pulls mom back into court or mediation over non-issues in parenting plan, or flat out fabricated problems. His lawyer is openly rude and unprofessional in emails to my mom/her lawyer. What are the consequences of these two things/are there even consequences?   Also, he wants my sister (who has a medical issue) to drive 3 hours each way to bring herself to and from him on his weekends as opposed to him meeting my mom halfway. This will be thrown out, right? Is my sister old enough to say ""I don't want to see him""?"	No
168	"Hey,  When I was 14 in 2003 I met a 24 year old man online whom I later found out I had a girlfriend. We started a sexual relationship in 2003 after I had turned 15, this happened a dozen times or more, and included everything barring penetrative sex, ending November 2004.  He told me he loved me, that he'd leave his partner for me, was my source of counsel and support while I was going through problems at home including going to live in foster care.  I know that at this time, the legal age of consent was 14 in Canada, and that this was ""upgraded"" to 16 in 2008 when I was 19, 4 years after the contact ended.  Are there any exceptions to this rule? I know there is a law that nullifies the age of consent law if he was in a position of authority, but he wasn't my baseball coach, nor was he a teacher. I have pretty in depth diary entries from that time to provide proof of my emotional state, and some verbatim copy and paste AIM messages between him and I.   Are you aware of any cases in Canadian criminal court where something like this was allowed to go ahead?  I would just take a walk down to my local police station and speak to a detective, but I live aboard now and am back in the city where this happened for 2 weeks in a few months, so any conversations I've had with detectives over the phone have been very hypothetical, but they've encouraged me to come down.  I appreciate all you can offer me in way of legal advice is a guide, as well as hypothetical. Regardless of what happens, I will of course still go to the station to give a statement and submit my evidence so that the detectives and attorneys can make a decision, but I'm sure you can imagine that being thousands of miles away, unable to speak to someone now, I am quite anxious.  Any advice is fully appreciated."	No
169	I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	No
170	I'm not sure which sub this should go in, but I recall seeing similar questions here. If there is a better sub, please direct me there.   My stepfather passed away suddenly. He didn't have much, but we need to handle his banking, cars, house, etc... No retirement, but of course he has some social security. He didn't have life insurance, but his wife did have some funeral insurance. His wife wants my wife (his daughter) to be the point person on this (executor?). What's the simplest, cheapest way to do this?  Our main concern right now is his car. He had a heart attack while driving and had a minor accident. The car was towed to a police lot. They will only release it to the owner. Well, he's passed away, and the technical owner is Carmax finance with whom he had a loan. They won't release it to his wife, stating they need legal ownership to claim the vehicle (she's not on the loan).	No
171	I'm currently drafting a non-fiction book about economics and the software development industry.  I want to compare charging an unreasonable amount or demanding excessive payment to the fictional character Rumpelstiltskin from the titular fairy tale.   As far as I'm aware, no one owns fairy tales and I'm allowed to do this - am I right?	No
172	Basically, I'll make this pretty concise and simple. I had a child that CPS was involved with during and after the birth due to a terrible decision of mine and a positive drug test. My aunt now has temporary custody. I have passed every drug test, I've complied with all court orders, and I'm on the way to getting my son back. However, the CPS workers involved have, behind closed doors, openly ridiculed me, accused me of altering drug tests but refusing to send them to a lab, and generally been very openly judgmental and difficult to get along with. So, my question is, WHO can I turn to as an advocate for my rights and complaints? The GAL? The CPS case worker's supervisor? A human rights advocate? Can I request a court-appointed attorney? Perhaps a change of venue to another county? Can my case worker be remanded due to personal bias? I've tried to research this information on my own, but only found information regarding proceedings and my rights, but not who I can contact as my advocate in the matter. Thank you to any and all who can point me in the right direction. Again, I live in Virginia.	No
173	I'm a guy and will be getting married later this year. As I understand it, here in California, it's $435 to file a change of name petition. My fiancée will also be changing her name, to take me (new) surname. I *believe* the $435 covers a family, assuming the changes are done at the same time. If so, makes sense for us to change them together. Can anyone verify?	No
