0	neither of the parties has cited any kentucky case law interpreting section 67.-710(7). however, the plain language of the statute indicates that the fiscal court has no general authority to nominate or appoint county employees. the statute grants the judge executive the authority to appoint, supervise, suspend, and remove county personnel, subject only to the approval of the fiscal court (emphasis added). this language clearly contemplates that, in general, only the judge executive may nominate persons for county employment, and that the fiscal court must either accept or reject those nominations. moreover, as noted earlier, the district court expressly held that under kentucky law, the terms of all county employees expire automatically at the end of each executive administration, and that [ajfter belcher was elected, [christian] had to be reappointed to the job of [fpa]. j.app. at 452. since we have found no kentucky authority to the contrary, we defer to the experienced district judges interpretation of the law of the state in which he sits. see deckebach v. la vida charters, inc. of florida, 867 f.2d 278, 285 n. 4 (6th cir.1989). finally, we reject christians contention that this interpretation of kentucky law will allow state employers to evade constitutional requirements concerning politically motivated job terminations. section 67.710(7) does not delegate decisionmaking authority to a judgment-proof, non-state entity, see, e.g., gilmore v. city of montgomery, 417 u.s. 556, 94 s.ct. 2416, 41 l.ed.2d 304 (1974), but rather places that authority with one state entity instead of another. moreover, as discussed below, since decisions not to reappoint state employees are treated the same as job terminations in this context, see branti v. finkel, 445 u.s. 507, 512 n. 6, 100 s.ct. 1287, 1291 n. 6, 63 l.ed.2d 574 (1980), our decision does not encourage politically-based job terminations under the guise of automatic dismissals and failures to reappoint. in sum, because kentucky law did not provide the magistrates with the authority to reappoint christian to county employment, we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment for the magistrates on christians first amendment claim.	Yes
1	contrary to the contention that the district court utilized the regulation to contradict the plain meaning of the statute, the court did not determine that the sentences were automatically to run consecutively rather than concurrently. the court merely cited the regulation as a method of clarifying the meaning of the phrase, such time as the parolee had originally served. the regulation served to show that the time in question referred to the time from the date of the appellants release on the first sentence to the date of execution of the parole warrant.	Yes
2	the plain meaning of subsection (a)(l)(a)(i) is that a hospital may appeal to the prrb a final decision by its fiscal intermediary as to the total amount of payment a hospital receives during a cost year. an intermediarys final decision is contained in the npr. it is clear that the issuance of this npr is a prerequisite to filing an appeal with the prrb regarding the intermediarys final decision as to the total payment due a hospital during a given year.	Yes

4	along with the assets, chiplease acquired rtcs liability for the tax credits comed had taken to compensate it for buying qualified-facility power at inflated rates. on january 4, 2007, the state of illinois filed an administrative expense claim against the estate for all of the tax credits comed took for power bought from rtcs pontiac, congress/hillside, and lyons facilities. as amended, the state sought a total of $1,518,048.72, plus another $14,358.82 for a separate tax-related claim that is not contested at this point. since some of comeds purchases had occurred before the 2006 amendment and others after it, the bankruptcy court raised the question whether the amendment to the act applies only prospectively (in which case chiplease would have no duty to reimburse for credits taken before june 6, 2006) or retroactively (in which case it would be required to reimburse all credits). ultimately, the bankruptcy court concluded that the illinois statute on statutes, 5 ilcs 70/4, requires the amendment to be construed _ prospectively. based on that legal determination, the court held chiplease liable only for the $175,710.58 in credits that comed took after the effective date of the amendment. the district court affirmed the bankruptcy courts ruling; it commented that [h]ad the legislature intended otherwise, it could have said so in plain language.	Yes
5	contrary to appellant, we believe the natural import of this language especially the words, shall be determined, and shall be allowed ... the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition is that the 502(h) claim takes on the characteristics of the original claim, including, in this case, its secured status. while allowed would seem to refer mainly to claimants right to participate in any dividend from the bankruptcy estate, determine is .used variously in the bankruptcy code, with one usage being the determination of secured status. 11 u.s.c. 506. we think the statute can be fairly read to imply that the secured or unsecured nature of the claim will be determined the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition. certainly, we can see no reason, nor any indication of legislative intent in 502(h), to strip a secured creditor of its secured claim in these circumstances. indeed, to do so would seem manifestly unfair. infra.	Yes
6	the viability of the villages arguments turns on the meaning of the dppa. our goal is to ascertain congresss purpose in enacting the legislation. e.g., milner v. dept of navy, u.s. -, 131 s.ct. 1259, 1264, 179 l.ed.2d 268 (2011) (quoting park n fly, inc. v. dollar park & fly, inc., 469 u.s. 189, 194, 105 s.ct. 658, 83 l.ed.2d 582 (1985)); united states v. n.e. rosenblum truck lines, 315 u.s. 50, 53, 62 s.ct. 445, 86 l.ed. 671 (1942). generally, the plain language of a statute is the best evidence of legislative intent. united states v. clintwood elkhorn mining co., 553 u.s. 1, 11, 128 s.ct. 1511, 170 l.ed.2d 392 (2008) (the strong presumption that the plain language of the statutes expresses congressional intent is rebutted only in rare and exceptional circumstances.) (quotation marks and alterations omitted); united states v. ye, 588 f.3d 411, 414-15 (7th cir.2009). in looking to the language of the dppa, we are mindful that statutory interpretation is a holistic endeavor, which requires courts to look at words and their meaning not in isolation, but in the context of the statutory scheme in which they appear. koons buick pontiac gmc, inc. v. nigh, 543 u.s. 50, 60, 125 s.ct. 460, 160 l.ed.2d 389 (2004).	Yes
7	380, 382 (1993), the supreme court examined the concept of excusable neglect while interpreting federal rule of bankruptcy procedure 9006(b)(1), which was modeled after and is substantially identical to federal rule of civil procedure 6(b)(1).7 the court rejected the notion that the rule permitted a late filing only when circumstances beyond a partys control prevented filing before the deadline, stating that the ordinary meaning of neglect encompasses both simple, faultless omissions to act and, more commonly, omissions caused by carelessness. id. at 388. but the court indicated that not all careless omissions would qualify; [b]ecause congress has provided no other guideposts for determining what sorts of neglect will be considered excusable, the court explained, the determination is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the partys omission. id. at 395. these include but are not limited to the danger of prejudice to the [opposing party], the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith. id	Yes
8	. even if the statutory language appeared clear, the plain meaning rule is only a primary and not a conclusive source of understanding and must yield on occasion to other indicia of legislative intent, including legislative history. see chesapeake & o. ry. co. v. united states, 571 f.2d 1190, 1194 (d.c.cir. 1977); see also watt v. alaska, 451 u.s. 259, 266 & n. 9, 101 s.ct. 1673, 1678 & n. 9, 68 l.ed.2d 80 (1981); aaron v. sec, 446 u.s. 680, 705-08, 100 s.ct. 1945, 1960-62, 64 l.ed.2d 611 (1980) (black-mun, j., concurring in part and dissenting in part).	Yes
9	the court began its analysis of the preemption question with the following aphorisms (1) the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute expresses congressional intent, (2) unless the statute explicitly and clearly states otherwise, congress does not intend to preempt areas which states traditionally have regulated, (3) federal statutes are not presumed to preempt state laws, and (4) courts should not read limitations into a statute to enlarge the statutes preemptive scope. the opinion then noted that the massachusetts statute appeared to be a law that regulated insurance and therefore would fall squarely within the saving clause. the court proceeded to analyze the statute and its legislative history and found nothing in either supporting a narrowing of the saving clause. the court led itself to conclude that the insurers interpretation of the statute would render the saving clause meaningless.	Yes
10	we look to the text of a statute to determine congressional intent, and look to legislative history only if the text is ambiguous. new rock asset partners, l.p. v. preferred entity advancements, inc., 101 f.3d 1492 (3d cir.1996). where statutory language is plain and unambiguous, the sole function of the court is to enforce it according to its terms. id. at 1498 (quoting united states v. ron pair enters., inc., 489 u.s. 235, 241, 109 s.ct. 1026, 103 l.ed.2d 290 (1989)). plain meaning is therefore conclusive, except in the rare cases [in which] the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters. id.	Yes
11	". such unambiguous language in a criminal statute ""should be accorded its plain meaning. united states v. dangdee, 616 f.2d 1118, 1119 (9th cir. 1980)."	Yes
12	". the majority relies on legislative history. because the plain text of the statutory definition of ""conviction makes clear that exhaustion or waiver of the right to a direct appeal is not required, i do not address that aspect of the majoritys reasoning. see bruesewitz v. wyeth inc., 561 f.3d 233, 244 (3d cir.2o09) (acknowledging that resort to legislative history is unnecessary ""if a statute is clear on its face); see also united states v. gregg, 226 f.3d 253, 257 (3d cir.2000) (""to determine a laws plain meaning, we begin with the language of the statute. if the language of the statute expresses congresss intent with sufficient precision, the inquiry ends there and the statute is enforced according to its terms.)."	Yes
13	magwood became eligible for the death penalty only when kyzer interpreted the statute to allow the charge in 13 11 2 to be used in lieu of a 13-11-6 aggravating circumstance for purposes of the judges written sentencing findings. the alabama supreme court admitted in kyzer that [a] literal and technical reading of the statute would not allow a defendant to be sentenced to death absent an aggravating circumstance as provided in 13 11 6. kyzer, 399 so.2d at 337. magwood did not have fair warning that a court, when faced with an unambiguous statute, would reject the literal interpretation. this conclusion is buttressed by the alabama supreme courts pronouncement that [t]he dicta in kyzer conflicts with the plain language of the alabama criminal code and that kyzer was incorrect. stephens, 982 so.2d at 1153.	Yes
14	finally, the type of interception involved in this case does not fall within the types of interceptions specifically excepted from the prohibitions of 2511. essentially, 2511 does not apply to interceptions of unscrambled, unencrypted radio communications that are either accessible to the general public or unencrypted and subject to a marketing system pursuant to which the interceptor has received authorization for private viewing. 1986 u.s.cong. & admin.news at 3568; 18 u.s.c. 2511(2)(g)(i) and (iii), note 7, supra. whereas, if the intercepted radio communication is scrambled or encrypted ... the conduct remains punishable under 2511. 1986 u.s.cong. & admin.news at 3575. this case involves this latter situation; modified descramblers intercept encrypted satellite transmissions. consequently, under the plain meaning of 2511, the intentional use of modified de-scramblers is prohibited, and there is no need to resort to the legislative history of the statute, unless it contains an explicit statement to the contrary.	Yes
15	the director correctly argues that the court must consider the language of the statute, guided by the plain and ordinary meaning of the words congress used. richards v. united states, 369 u.s. 1, 9, 82 s.ct. 585, 590, 7 l.ed.2d 492 (1961). but the director insists we must apply a narrow definition of wages which excludes fringe benefits because when congress enacted the statute in 1927 it would not have considered such benefits to be part of an employees wages. the director further argues that only by congressional amendment could the acts description of wages be expanded to include fringe benefits. although the concept of wages may have changed since 1927, we do not find that congress intended an inflexible meaning of wages in the definition provided by section 902(13). examining the plain meaning of the language congress used, we note that several fringe benefits were listed including the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer .... id. this language indicates a flexible definition encompassing other fringe benefits not specifically mentioned by congress that provide the employee with a similar advantage. moreover, the standard of liberal construction of the act in favor of claimants suggests that freers broader interpretation of wages should be adopted to include employer contributions to health and pension plans. see voris v. eikel, 346 u.s. 328, 74 s.ct. 88, 98 l.ed. 5 (1953); baltimore & philadelphia steamboat co. v. norton, 284 u.s. 408, 414, 52 s.ct. 187, 189, 76 l.ed. 366 (1932).	Yes
16	the tca includes a fundamentally different preemption provision than either of the provisions considered by the supreme court in national meat and engine manufacturers. neither of the federal statutes in those cases sandwiched their preemption clause between preservation and savings clauses that explicitly and repeatedly reiterated local authority over product sales. unlike the preemption provisions considered in those caseswhich the supreme court characterized as sweep[ing] widely and categoricalthe tcas plain text distinguishes between tobacco product standards and state or local regulation of the final sale of tobacco products, preempting the former while allowing the latter. national meat and engine manufacturers are inapposite and dont control this case. rather than following precedent interpreting very different federal statutory language, we must instead be guided by the tcas unique text, framework, and history.	Yes
17	at step one of chevron, we conclude congress has not directly spoken to the interplay of 1158(a)(1) and 1231(a)(5). on the contrary, 1158(a)(1) and 1231(a)(5) are in apparent conflict. section 1158 broadly grants any alien the opportunity to seek asylum, regardless of such aliens status, subject only to a few exceptions not applicable here. section 1231, by contrast, expressly bars aliens subject to reinstated removal orders from any relief under chapter 12, the chapter that includes asylum. in attempting to resolve this apparent conflict, we begin with the language of the statute, reading it in context and giving undefined terms their ordinary meanings. see csx transp., inc. v. ala. dept of revenue, 562 u.s. 277, 283-84, 131 s.ct. 1101, 179 l.ed.2d 37 (2011); synagogue v. united states, 482 f.3d 1058, 1061-62 (9th cir. 2007). our goal is to understand the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme and to fit, if possible, all parts into a harmonious whole. gila river indian cmty. v. united states, 729 f.3d 1139, 1145 (9th cir. 2013) (quoting fda v. brown & williamson tobacco corp., 529 u.s. 120, 133, 120 s.ct. 1291, 146 l.ed.2d 121 (2000)).	Yes
18	to be sure, 581 is not a model of statutory clarity. its construction and circular use of the term bank are inherently ambiguous. having carefully considered this question, however, we concluded that the most consistent and harmonious reading of this section supports the tax courts conclusion that being a bank within the commonly understood meaning of that term is an independent requirement.	Yes
19	of course, the dissent is correct that [w]hen the supreme court has issued a statutory decision and congress then acts to change the relevant law, it flouts congressional will for a lower court to ignore the new statute and rely reflexively on the result of the old supreme court case. dissenting op. at 12. but this principle has no application here because congress never change[d] the relevant law. as we have shown above, irca neither explicitly nor implicitly amended the nlra. thus, this case is nothing like the examples the dissent cites in which the supreme court interpreted a statute and congress later amended that statute. see id. at 12. in those examples, congress obviously overturned the supreme courts decisions it expressly changed the statutory provision the court had interpreted to achieve the opposite result. by contrast, after the sure-tan court read the plain language of the nlras definition of employee to cover undocumented aliens, congress did not change the nlra to expressly exempt! ] undocumented aliens from its coverage. sure-tan, 467 u.s. at 892, 104 s.ct. 2803. instead, congress changed immigration law, never even hinting it intended to amend the nlra. congresss decision not to amend the nlras definition of employee is all the more striking given that it has previously amended that definition when it disagreed with the supreme courts interpretation of the act. see labor management relations act, 1947, pub.l. no. 80-101, 2(3), 61 stat. 136, 137-38 (amending the nlras definition of employee to exclude independent contractors and supervisors, whom the supreme court had held covered under the original version of the act in nlrb v. hearst publications, inc., 322 u.s. 111, 131-32, 64 s.ct. 851, 88 l.ed. 1170 (1944), and packard motor car co. v. nlrb, 330 u.s. 485, 488-90, 67 s.ct. 789, 91 l.ed. 1040 (1947), respectively); see also kimbrough v. united states, u.s. -, 128 s.ct. 558, 571, 169 l.ed.2d 481 (2007) (drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, for congress has shown that it knows how to [address the question at issue] in express terms.).	Yes
20	. as the supreme court and this court have often stated, when addressing cases involving statutory construction, the starting point must be the language employed by congress. reiter v. sonotone corp., 442 u.s. 330, 337, 99 s.ct. 2326, 2330, 60 l.ed.2d 931 (1979); american tobacco co. v. patterson, - u.s. ------, 102 s.ct. 1534, 1537, 71 l.ed.2d 748 (1982); mountain brook orchards, inc. v. marshall, 640 f.2d 454, 456 (3rd cir. 1981). see bread political action committee v. fec, - u.s.--, 102 s.ct. 1235, 1237, 71 l.ed.2d 432 (1982); dawson chemical co. v. rohm & haas co., 448 u.s. 176, 187, 100 s.ct. 2601, 2608, 65 l.ed.2d 696 (1980); schramm v. department of health & human services, 682 f.2d 85, at 87 (3d cir. 1982). by doing so, we presume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used. richards v. united states, 369 u.s. 1, 9, 82 s.ct. 585, 590, 7 l.ed.2d 492 (1962). consequently, [a]bsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive. american tobacco co. v. patterson, - u.s. , 102 s.ct. 1534, 1537, 71 l.ed.2d 748 (1982) (quoting consumer product safety commission v. gte sylvania, inc., 447 u.s. 102, 108, 100 s.ct. 2051, 2056, 64 l.ed.2d 766 (1980).	Yes
21	the bankruptcy judge in sss enterprises found that the disjunctive language, after the appointment of a trustee under section 702, 1104, 1163, 1302, or 1202, plainly means that each trustee appointed under a different chapter of the code gives rise to a fresh two year period in which to bring actions under 547. 145 b.r. at 918. we respectfully disagree. in our view, the disjunctive language only specifies that the single, continuous, two-year statute of limitations begins to run with the appointment of a trustee under one of the enumerated chapters, not that the limitations period should start over if the case is subsequently converted to another chapter and a new trustee is appointed. we find any other reading of the disjunctive language to be unnatural. see bacon, 21 f.3d at 211 (quoting cooper corp., 312 u.s. at 605, 61 s.ct. at 744) (courts are to read the statutory language in its ordinary and natural sense).	Yes
22	to understand damage, we consult both the statutory text and ordinary usage. under the cfaa, any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information qualifies as damage. id. 1030(e)(8). because the statute includes no definition for three key terms impairment, integrity, and availability we look to the ordinary meanings of these words. see united states v. plavcak, 411 f.3d 655, 660-61 (6th cir.2005). impairment means a deterioration or an injurious lessening or weakening. 7 oxford english dictionary 696 (2d ed.1989) [hereinafter oed], the definition of integrity includes an uncorrupted condition, an original perfect state, and soundness. id. at 1066. and availability is the capability of being employed or made use of. 1 oed, supra, at 812. applying these ordinary usages, we conclude that a transmission that weakens a sound computer system or, similarly, one that diminishes a plaintiffs ability to use data or a system causes damage.	Yes
23	the statute provides that [a] person who violates subsection (a) by presenting a fraudulent lien is liable to each injured person[ ] for damages. tex. crv. prac. & rem.code 12.002(a)-(b). that plain language is liable to each injured person is directly contrary to the companies assertion that damages may be awarded only for each piece of property subjected to a fraudulent lien rather than to each claimant. both maria and arturo trevino were named on the allegedly fraudulent liens. none of the cases cited by defendants in support of their interpretation of the statute is relevant to this issue.	Yes
24	third, septa argues that congress could not have intended 28103(b) to have preemptive effect because congress chose to include an explicit statement of preemption in another subsection of the statute, 28103(a). congress knew how to broadly preempt state law if it so intended, septa argues, and congress did not intend to do so by subsection (b). we acknowledge that 28103(b) does not contain an express preemption clause. however, even though subsection (b) is not expressly preemptive, it is still quite clear. the preemptive consequences of its language are sufficiently plain for us to say that congress intended to obviate all obstacles to the enforceability of contracts to indemnify amtrak. further, the expression of preemption in one subsection does not mean that preemption was not intended by the language of another subsection on another topic. see bruesewitz, 561 f.3d at 239 ([ijmplied preemption may exist even in the face of an express preemption clause.); see also freightliner corp. v. myrick, 514 u.s. 280, 288, 115 s.ct. 1483, 131 l.ed.2d 385 (1995) (noting that an express preemption clause in a statute does not foreclose [the] possibility of implied preemption). again, the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case, holk 575 f.3d at 334, and, as discussed above, the purpose here is not in doubt: 28103(b) was passed to clarif[y] that rail passenger service indemnification agreements entered into by amtrak and other parties are enforceable. senate report at 14.	Yes
25	as the court notes, since the minnesota supreme court has not specifically decided this issue, it falls to us to predict how that court would interpret the statute.- in so doing, we are bound by minnesotas rules of statutory interpretation. see gershman v. am. cas. co. of reading, pa, 251 f.3d 1159, 1162 (8th cir.2001). if statutory language is plain and unambiguous, the court must look only to the plain meaning of the statutory language. boutin v. la-fleur, 591 n.w.2d 711, 715 (minn.1999). words and phrases are to be given their ordinary meaning. state v. larivee, 656 n.w.2d 226, 229 (minn.2003), cert. denied, 540 u.s. 812, 124 s.ct. 56, 157 l.ed.2d 25 (2003); see also minn.stat. 645.08 (providing, as a canon of statutory construction, that words are to be construed according to their common and approved usage). the statute provides that prever-dict interest on pecuniary damages is to be computed from the time of commencement of the action. . there is nothing ambiguous about the words of the statute, so i believe the. minnesota supreme court would simply apply their ordinary meaning.	Yes
26	". the court also rejected the flras contention that the term ""applicable laws in section 7106(a)(2) should be read to be coextensive with the phrase ""any law, rule, or regulation in the definition of a grievance in section 7103(a)(9)(c)(ii). under that reading, of course, employees would have had the same right to grieve concerning decisions in the areas reserved to management authority under section 7106(a) as they would have in any other area. the court decided that such a reading was contrary to the plain language of the statute. see irs v. flra, 494 u.s. at 932, 110 s.ct. at 1629."	Yes
27	the statutory waiver is express, and its range is defined in unmistakable language. to say that a private person, but not the united states, is liable under title vii for interest as an element of an attorneys fee would rob the unambiguous statutory language of its plain meaning. it would defeat the statutory imposition upon the united states of a liability for costs, and the statutory inclusion of a reasonable attorneys fee as part of the costs, identical to that of a private party in similar circumstances. the scope-setting statutory words the same as a private person mark out the united states liability for attorneys fees as well as costs in the traditional sense. our responsibility as judges is to enforce this provision according to its terms.	Yes
28	arguably, guerreros strongest argument is that we should adopt the dissents position in pacheco, 225 f.3d at 155-61. the difficulty with the dissents approach is that it focuses upon the plain meaning of the term aggravated felony, by exploring the ordinary, common sense meaning of each of these words. the statute, however, includes more than these two words: the term aggravated felony means ... 8 u.s.c. 1101(a)(43). the dissent does not address the word means, and instead concentrates on the term aggravated felony, and thus concludes that it is difficult to conceive of how a misdemeanor could be a felony, let alone an aggravated felony. while this approach to the issue is not without a certain logic, it places a heavy emphasis upon the two words -that is, aggravated and felony without discussing the full statute in which these two words appear. consequently, the dissents analysis operates in a type of vacuum, and as a result, does not grapple with either the structure and context of the complete statute or congress intent when it enacted the aggravated felony provision, 8 u.s.c. 1227(a)(2)(a)(iii), and its attendant meaning, 8 u.s.c. 1101(a)(43).	Yes
29	we give words their ordinary meaning when interpreting a statute. see animal legal defense fund v. united states dept. of agriculture, 933 f.3d 1088, 1093 (9th cir. 2019) (when a statute does not define a term, we typically give the phrase its ordinary meaning. (internal quotation marks omitted)) (quoting fcc v. at & t inc., 562 u.s. 397, 403 (2011)). the ordinary meaning of the word departure refers to a volitional act. it would be quite strange to say, for example, the suspect departed the crime scene when police took him into custody. though it might be possible to use departure in a non-volitional sense, there is a distinction  lopez-angel v. barr 13	Yes
30	in summary, the court announces a sound principle that, in dual residence cases, deductibility of traveling expenses depends upon a showing that both residences were maintained for business reasons. if that principle is understood to be derived from the language of section 162(a)(2) taken as a whole, home retains operative significance for determining which of the business-related residences is the one the expense of which can be treated as deductible. in this context, home should be given its ordinary meaning to allow a deduction only for expenses relating to an abode that is not the taxpayers principal place of residence. on the undisputed facts in this case, the tax court found that boston was the taxpayers home in the everyday sense, i. e., her principal place of residence. were the issue relevant to disposition of the case, i would uphold the tax courts quite reasonable determination on the evidence before it. however, because the taxpayer had no business reason for maintaining both residences, her deduction for expenses associated with maintaining a second residence closer than her principal residence to her place of employment must be disallowed without regard to which of her two residences was her home under section 162(a)(2).	Yes
31	we conclude that the 541(c)(2) exclusion is not lost merely because the ira document itself does not contain the restriction, it being contained instead in the georgia statute. our conclusion is supported by the plain meaning of the language of 541(e)(2), which requires only that the restriction be enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. nothing in the language of the statute suggests that the restriction must be contained both within a relevant nonbankruptcy statute and also within the trust instrument itself. section 18-4-22(a) of the official code of georgia annotated clearly constitutes applicable nonbankruptcy law. in order for the restriction in 18-4-22(a) to be enforceable, nothing in georgia law requires that the restriction be repeated in any ira document. common sense also supports our interpretation; a restriction is no less enforceable because it is located in the statute rather than in the document.	Yes
32	we begin by first examining rfras plain language. see barma v. holder, 640 f.3d 749, 751 (7th cir.2011) (noting statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of the statute). it states, [g]overnment shall not substantially burden a persons exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability. ... 42 u.s.c. 2000bb-l(a). subsection (b) provides an exception, stating that [gjovernment may substantially burden a persons exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. 42 u.s.c. 2000bb-l(b). in other words, this is a burden shifting test in which the government must make a showing after the plaintiff demonstrates a substantial burden. rweyemamu v. cote, 520 f.3d 198, 203 n. 2 (2d cir.2008) ([w]e think the text of rfra is plain ... in that it requires the government to demonstrate that application of a burden to a person is justified by a compelling governmental interest (emphasis in' original) (internal citation omitted)). it is self-evident that the government cannot meet its burden if it is not party to the suit. see hankins v. lyght, 441 f.3d 96, 114-15 (2d cir.2006) (sotomayor, j., dissenting) (where, as here, the government is not a party, it cannot go [] forward with any evidence. in my view, this provision strongly suggests that congress did not intend rfra to apply in suits between private parties.). a private party cannot step into the shoes of the government and demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and that it is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest because the statute explicitly says that the government must make this showing.	Yes
33	-16-  to determine whether a statute is ambiguous, we start with its plain language. see ark. afl-cio v. f.c.c., 11 f.3d 1430, 1440 (8th cir. 1993) (en banc). if congressional intent is clearly discernable, the agency must act in accordance with that intent and the court need not defer to the agencys interpretation of its mandate. id. thus, we must determine whether congress intended hhs to have the authority to regulate ltc facilities use of arbitration agreements. see friends of the boundary waters wilderness v. bosworth, 437 f.3d 815, 823 (8th cir. 2006).	Yes
34	in any event, the congressmans pronouncement is no substitute for the plain meaning of the statute. see, e.g., pennsylvania dept of pub. welfare v. davenport, 495 u.s. 552, 557-58, 110 s.ct. 2126, 2130, 109 l.ed.2d 588 (1990) (our construction of the term debt is guided by the fundamental canon that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute itself.) (interpreting the term debt as it appears in the bankruptcy code). section 3002(3) defines debt as an amount that is owing to the united states on account of a direct loan (subsection (a)) or on account of a fee, duty, lease, rent, service, - sale of real or personal property, overpayment, fine, assessment, penalty, restitution, damages, interest, tax, bail bond forfeiture, reimbursement, recovery of a cost incurred by the united states, or other source of indebtedness to the united states (subsection (b)). an nlrb back-pay award to private employees is simply neither an amount owing to the united states nor an indebtedness to the united states. while the analysis might be different if the united states had previously satisfied the employees claims and was itself looking to recover by way of subrogation, those circumstances are not presented here.	Yes
35	the district court strayed beyond the parameters of section 6103 when it sought to determine agent thomas subjective intent and when it concluded that insufficient justification was shown to warrant delving into whether cash payments were made. that inquiry misperceives the function of section 6103(k)(6), which is to limit disclosures to those necessary to obtain the information sought. the section does not require the irs to justify the appropriateness or need for the information sought so long as such information relates to the determination of tax liability and is not otherwise reasonably available. in other words, section 6103 does not provide a vehicle to test the probable cause or any other level of justification to investigate. see barrett v. united states, 795 f.2d 446, 451 (5th cir.1986) (in a section 7431 action, the court does not inquire whether the information sought is necessary); cf. united states v. powell, 379 u.s. 48, 57, 85 s.ct. 248, 254, 13 l.ed.2d 112 (1964) (irs does not require probable cause to issue summons); united states v. mackay, 608 f.2d 830, 832 (10th cir.1979) (same). the plain language of section 6103 does not limit in any way what information the irs may seek in the course of an investigation. section 6103 merely imposes certain restrictions on the irss ability to make disclosures in seeking that information. see barrett, 795 f.2d at 451 ([w]e do not question the right, wisdom, or necessity of a particular irs investigation. we do question, however, the means of investigation, but only to the limited extent consistent with section 7431.). the three re quirements that section 6103(k)(6) imposes to permit an irs agent to disclose return information were all met here. thus, we hold that section 6103 did not prevent agent thomas from seeking information regarding cash payments even if she did not suspect cash payments and even if the badges of fraud could be legitimately explained.	Yes
36	for an enhancement based on a state conviction, the state crime must not stretch further than the generic definition of the enumerated crime. taylor v. united states, 495 u.s. 575, 599-601, 110 s.ct. 2143, 109 l.ed.2d 607 (1990). to resolve whether a state statute is more expansive than an enumerated crime, courts must examine the statutory definition of the offense to determine whether an associated conviction necessarily satisfies the elements of the generic crime, as that crime is understood in its ordinary, contemporary meaning. guerrero-navarro, 737 f.3d at 978. this is a categorical, common-sense analysis, and courts do not look to the actual facts of the conviction. taylor, 495 u.s. at 599-600, 110 s.ct. 2143; murillo-lopez, 444 f.3d at 339-40.	Yes
37	the constitutional right at issue is defined in the plain text of the statute. knussman had a right not to be discriminated against on the basis of his gender. this inquiry does not require consideration of whether the legislature drew a permissible distinction in law based on gender. the statute is completely devoid of gender classification. significantly, the nurturing leave statute applies to adoption as well as the birth of a child; therefore, no biological gender classification is implied or inherent in the process of determining whether the leave applicant is a primary care giver or a secondary care giver. in 1994, knussman sought leave as a primary care giver pursuant to the nurturing leave statute, which provided 30 days leave for primary care givers and ten days leave for secondary care givers for parents of newborns and newly adopted children. cloaked with the authority as the manager of medical leave benefits for the maryland state department of police, mulli-neaux took it upon herself to interpret this gender neutral statute in a gender specific manner. mullineaux categorically denied knussmans request for leave to care for his newborn daughter as a primary care giver because knussman was a man. knussman brought suit against mulli-neaux, and others, for categorically denying him leave as a primary care giver because of his gender in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. therefore, for the purpose of analyzing knussmans claim, this court must look at a persons right not to have a gender neutral statute applied in a discriminatory manner and determine if such right was clearly established at the time of mullineauxs actions in 1994.	Yes
38	our conclusion is well supported by the legislative history of 440(d). the senate version of aedpa included an express provision making 440(d) retroactive. see sandoval, 166 f.3d at 241 (citing s. 735, 104th cong. 303(f) (1995)). a comparable section of the version of the bill introduced in the house did not contain retroactive language. see id. (citing h.r. 2703, 104th cong. 662 (1996)). the final bill dropped the language from the senates version that would have made 440(d) applicable to pending 212(c) applications. ostensibly, congress had considered a retroactivity provision but decided against it. with such strong evidence of congressional intent, we refuse to include in the language of the statute a provision that congress chose to omit. few principles of statutory construction are more compelling than the proposition that congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language. cardoza-fonseca, 480 u.s. at 442-43, 107 s.ct. 1207 (quoting nachman corp. v. pension benefit guaranty corp., 446 u.s. 359, 392-93, 100 s.ct. 1723, 64 l.ed.2d 354 (1980) (stewart, j., dissenting)). to allow the attorney generals opinion to stand would permit the executive branch to effectively thwart the intent of congress, made plain through a careful reading of the statutory provision at issue. goncalves, 144 f.3d at 127.	Yes
39	the ada and rehabilitation act regulations also assist courts in determining whether a particular endeavor may properly be considered a major life activity. rather than enunciating a general principle for determining what is and is not a major life activity, [these] regulations instead provide a representative list, defining [the] term to include functions such as caring for ones self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. bragdon, 524 u.s. at -, 118 s.ct. at 2205 (quoting 45 c.f.r. 84.3(j)(2)(ii) (1997); 28 c.f.r. 41.31(b)(2) (1997)); see also 29 c.f.r. 1630.2g) (1998). as the department of health and human services asserts, this list is not exhaustive. for example, other major life activities include, but are not limited to, sitting, standing, lifting, and reaching. 29 c.f.r. pt. 1630, app. at 347 (1998). finally, if the asserted major life activity is not one of the examples listed above, under the plain meaning of the word major, the touchstone for determining an activitys inclusion under the statutory rubric is its significance. see bragdon, 524 u.s. at -, 118 s.ct. at 2205 (quoting abbott v. bragdon, 107 f.3d 934, 940 (1st cir.1997)). for example, this court in pack v. kmart corp., 166 f.3d 1300, 1302 (10th cir.1999) recently recognized that sleeping, although not enumerated in the regulations, constitutes a major life activity, while concentration does not. the court asserted, in deciding whether a particular activity is a major life activity, we ask whether the activity is significant within the meaning of the ada. pack v. kmart corp., 1999 wl 51882, at *3. we then held	Yes
40	generally, deference is due to an agencys interpretation of a statute involving its area of expertise. united states v. cornell, 389 u.s. 299, 307, 88 s.ct. 445, 449, 19 l.ed.2d 537 (1967). however, this deference only sets the framework for judicial analysis; it does not displace it. united states v. cartwright, 411 u.s. 546, 550, 93 s.ct. 1713, 1716, 36 l.ed.2d 528 (1973). the standard of review for considering an agencys application of its regulation has long been whether the regulation or interpretation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin and its purpose. rowan companies, inc. v. united states, 452 u.s. 247, 101 s.ct. 2288, 2292, 68 l.ed.2d 814 (1981). accord, united states v. vogel fertilizer co., 455 u.s. 16, 102 s.ct. 821, 828, 70 l.ed.2d 792 (1982) ([it] is not a reasonable statutory interpretation unless it harmonizes with the statutes origin and purpose. )	Yes
41	when congress uses a non-technical word in a tax statute, presumably it wants administrators and courts to read it in the way that ordinary people would understand, and not to draw on some unexpressed spirit outside the bounds of the normal meaning of words. addison v. holly hill fruit prods., inc., 322 u.s. 607, 617, 64 s.ct. 1215, 1221, 88 l.ed. 1488 (1944).	Yes
42	the fifth amendment guarantees every citizen the right to due process. stemming from this guarantee is the concept that vague statutes are void. united states v. washam, 312 f.3d 926, 929 (8th cir.2002) (citing connally v. gen. const. co., 269 u.s. 385, 391, 46 s.ct. 126, 70 l.ed. 322 (1926)). the vagueness doctrine recognizes that [a] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law. id. (quoting connally, 269 u.s. at 391, 46 s.ct. 126). in other words, [v]oid for vagueness simply means that criminal re sponsibility should not attach where one could not reasonably understand that his contemplated conduct is proscribed. id. (quoting united states v. natl dairy prods. corp., 372 u.s. 29, 32-33, 83 s.ct. 594, 9 l.ed.2d 561 (1963)); see also grayned v. city of rockford, 408 u.s. 104, 108, 92 s.ct. 2294, 33 l.ed.2d 222 (1972) ([l]aws [must] give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.). to defeat [birbraghers] vagueness challenge, [the csa] must pass a two-part test: the statute must first provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct, and second, not lend itself to arbitrary enforcement. united states v. barraza, 576 f.3d 798, 806 (8th cir.2009) (quotation omitted).	Yes
43	in sum, although part of this courts reasoning in akinseye has been superseded by the district of columbia circuit courts holdings in kaseman and jester, that does not compel the conclusion that the statute of limitations applicable to a prevailing partys claim for attorneys fees under the idea is not the three-year catch-all provision of d.c.code 12-301(8) as the defendant argues. thus, the court again finds that it is the statute most analogous to the claims that have been filed in this case, akinseye, 193 f.supp.2d at 145, for two reasons. first, the plain language and statutory construction of the idea evidences a congressional intent to impose a different limitations period for judicial appeals of idea administrative hearing decisions. and second, the policy considerations underlying the enactment of the idea command a longer limitations period for prevailing parties claims for attorneys fees.	Yes
44	to understand the legal consequences of northwests rejection, we turn first to the plain text of 1113, see leocal v. ashcroft, 543 u.s. 1, 8, 125 s.ct. 377, 160 l.ed.2d 271 (2004); conn. natl bank v. germain, 503 u.s. 249, 252, 112 s.ct. 1146, 117 l.ed.2d 391 (1992), and then to that of the rla, reading these two statutory schemes seriatim, from the most recent to the oldest, see, e.g., shugrue v. air line pilots assn, intl (in re ionosphere clubs, inc.), 922 f.2d 984, 991 (2d cir. 1990) ([w]e must give effect to the most recently enacted statute since it is the most recent indication of congressional intent.), and from the more specific to the more general, see, e.g., morton v. mancari, 417 u.s. 535, 550-51, 94 s.ct. 2474, 41 l.ed.2d 290 (1974). we also assume that congress passed each subsequent law with full knowledge of the existing legal landscape, miles v. apex marine corp., 498 u.s. 19, 32, 111 s.ct. 317, 112 l.ed.2d 275 (1990) (we assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.), and without intending the absurd, see green v. bock laundry mach. co., 490 u.s. 504, 509-10, 109 s.ct. 1981, 104 l.ed.2d 557 (1989).	Yes
45	brimberry contends that the instruction employed an overly broad reading of the statute. the phrase property belonging to the estate of a debtor should be interpreted narrowly, brimberry asserts, because the phrase was not defined in the statute and the ordinary meaning of the phrase does not encompass assets which a trustee may acquire title to in a legal proceeding. see united states v. bass, 404 u.s. 336, 347-48, 92 s.ct. 515, 522-23, 30 l.ed.2d 488 (1971) ( ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity. ).	Yes
46	"section 4 of the clayton act states, in pertinent part, that any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor ... and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorneys fee."" 15 u.s.c. 15(a) (emphasis added). it is clear from the plain meaning of section 4 that an injury is all that is required for an award of attorneys fees. an award of attorneys fees to the injured party is mandatory. christiansburg garment co. v. eeoc, 434 u.s. 412, 415 & n. 5, 98 s.ct. 694, 697 & n. 5 (1978); alyeska pipeline serv. co. v. wilderness socy, 421 u.s. 240, 261, 95 s.ct. 1612, 1623, 44 l.ed.2d 141 (1975); hydrolevel corp. v. american socy of mechanical engrs, inc., 635 f.2d 118, 130 (2d cir.1980), aff'd, 456 u.s. 556, 102 s.ct. 1935, 72 l.ed.2d 330 (1982). in the instant case, the jury found that the nfls monopolization of the united states major league professional football market injured the usfl. an injury having been found, the awarding of attorneys fees to the usfl was compulsory."	Yes
47	given the plain and unambiguous language of the statute and the absence of any extraordinary contrary legislative history which suggests that we should deviate from the text, we are compelled to conclude that other than the threshold showing that the agency in question received more than $10,000 in federal benefits in any one-year period, 666 imposes no requirement that there be a connection between the offense conduct and the federal funds. see morgan, 230 f.3d at 1073 (bye, j., concurring) (concluding that a federal nexus requirement should not be read into 666 on the grounds that the court should not inject elements into plain and unambiguous statutes); george d. brown, stealth statute corruption, the spending power, and the rise of 18 u.s.c. 666, 73 notre dame l.rev. 247, 280-81 (1998) ([i]t is impossible to deny that the actual statute is the antithesis of narrow. fairly read, it gives the federal government authority to deal with a range of malfeasance anywhere within governmental ... entities that benefit from a variety of programs, whether or not the wrongdoing is connected to the federal assistance.).	Yes
48	the text of 1605(a)(3), as we have explained, applies foursquare to genocidal takings committed by a state against its nationals. and nothing in the provisions history or context compels us to read the statute in a manner at odds with its plain terms. to be sure, international law traditionally did not regulate conduct between a sovereign and its subjects. see 1 oppenheims intl law 849. but world war ii marked a change in that landscape, leading to recognition of certain international-law norms that protect individuals from inhuman treatment by states, even if the [offending] state is that state whose nationality the individual has. id. at 851. in particular, the condemnation of genocide as contrary to international law quickly achieved broad acceptance by the community of nations in the aftermath of the war and the nuremberg trials. kadic, 70 f.3d at 241; see princz v. federal republic of germany, 26 f.3d 1166, 117374 (d.c.cir.1994). by the time of the expropriation exceptions enactment in 1976 as part of the fsia, genocide had long been identified as an international law crime as evidenced by the genocide convention, article 2, adopted in 1948.	Yes
49	further, as the majority notes, the use of different' terms within related statutory provisions gives rise to an implication that different meanings were intended. see majority op. at-(citing 2a n. singer, statutes and statutory construction 46.06 (6th ed.2000)). here, va.code ann. 46.2-1094(d)s reference to a violation of this section contrasts with 46.2-1094(f)s explicit reference to the issuance of a citation for a violation of this section. thus, one may be cited for a violationimplying that a violation refers to something other than the official determination of a violation itself. the statute itself discusses a violation as antecedent to, and distinct from, a citation for a violation. the structure of 46.2-1094 and the ordinary legal meaning of the word violation thus lead me to conclude that a violation of 46.2-1094 as used in 46.2-1094(d) refers to the conduct that establishes all of the elements of a violation of 46.2-1094 rather than to the fact of an official citation or adjudication of a violation.	Yes
50	the plain language of the statute, the legislative history, and the decisions of the supreme court and other courts lead us to conclude that the district court and the totten court erred in reading a presentment requirement into all subsections of the false claims act. we hold that while liability under 3729(a)(1) turns on whether a claim has been presented to the government, subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) do not require such a showing. rather, a relator under these two subsections must show that government money was used to pay the false or fraudulent claim. this requirement comports with the policy rationale behind the fca protecting the government fisc while ensuring that the statute applies only to claims submitted to the government and not to private entities.	Yes
51	to convey adequate warning under constitutional mandates, a statute need not satisfy impossible standards of precision; rather, all that is required is that the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. united states v. petrillo, 332 u.s. 1, 8, 67 s.ct. 1538, 1542, 91 l.ed. 1877 (1947). defendants argument that the word lascivious is unconstitutionally vague under this standard is without merit. this court agrees with the reasoning of the ninth circuit that lascivious is no different in its meaning than lewd, a commonsensical term whose constitutionality was specifically upheld in miller v. california, 413 u.s. 15, 25, [93 s.ct. 2607, 2615, 37 l.ed.2d 419] (1973), and in ferber, 458 u.s. at 765 [102 s.ct. at 3358]. united states v. wiegand, 812 f.2d 1239, 1243 (9th cir.), cert. denied, u.s.-, 108 s.ct. 164, 98 l.ed.2d 118 (1987).	Yes
52	accordingly, we must look beyond the plain language of the statute for guidance. when faced with a similarly ambiguous tax code provision, the supreme court thoroughly examined the history and purpose of the tax provision at issue, past practices, and the practical implications of its ruling. commissioner v. engle, 464 u.s. 206, 104 s.ct. 597, 78 l.ed.2d 420 (1984). we follow suit, beginning with the history and purpose of the marital deduction.	Yes
53	i know of no authority that' allows a criminal statute that covers conduct of certain persons to be interpreted to extend to others it does not cover, on grounds that not to do so violates constitutional equal protection provisions. certainly, the california case of long beach city employees assn v. city of long beach, 41 cal.3d 937, 227 cal.rptr. 90, 719 p.2d 660 (1986), relied upon by the majority, does not do so. long beach employ ees simply held that a legislative scheme that outlawed involuntary polygraph tests for some private and public employees but permitted them for other public employees denied those other public employees equal protection of the law. the court, therefore, enjoined a public agency from requiring polygraph tests of its employees. criminal or civil liability was not imposed on anyone by that decision. here, the majority reinterprets the plain language of a criminal statute to impose criminal and civil liability on police officers on the grounds that failure to do so would violate the equal protection clause of the california constitution. i find no justification for such an approach.	Yes
54	it is not insignificant that both chief judge motley and a panel of the fourth circuit, giardino, v. united states, no. 80-1822, (4th cir. july 7, 1981), have found the language of section 2039(c) perfectly clear on its face. we agree with their conclusion. although some of the governments arguments have surface plausibility, we are of the view that for the government to succeed, we must initially find the statutory language ambiguous. this we are unable to do. the plain language of section 2039(c) states that only lump sum distributions, as described in section 402(e)(4), received from qualified pension plans are to be included in a decedents gross estate. nothing in the statute supports the governments theory that only the requirement of section 402(e)(4)(a) need be met, without regard to the explicit language of subsection (b) requiring the taxpayer to elect lump sum treatment. indeed, to read the statute as the government urges would require a deliberate misinterpretation of the statutes express language or the equally improper insertion of a new modifying phrase.	Yes

56	while we recognize that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature, united states v. albertini 472 u.s. 675, 105 s.ct. 2897, 2902, 86 l.ed.2d 536 (1985), it is nevertheless the fact that the supreme court has on several occasions applied to acts of congress [a] restrictive meaning for what appear to be plain words where such a restrictive meaning must be given if a broader meaning would generate constitutional doubts. united states v. witkovich, 353 u.s. 194, 77 s.ct. 779, 782, 1 l.ed.2d 765 (1957). thus, in witkovich the wording of the challenged statutory-section read in isolation and literally conferred on the attorney general authority to require whatever information he deems desirable of aliens whose deportation has not been effected within six months after it has been commanded. id. but the court, rejecting the tyranny of literalness, and relying instead on the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, id., held that the appropriate construction was to limit the statute to authorizing all questions reasonably calculated to keep the attorney general advised regarding the continued availability for departure of aliens whose deportation is overdue. id. at 784.

57	as the district court observed, the government certainly [did] not act[] with diligence in giving [the] notice required by 3505(b). however, we conclude that this lack of diligence did not render the records inadmissible under the statute. the plain language of 3505 does not make compliance with the notice requirement a prerequisite to the admissibility of evidence under the statute. first, subsection (a) of 3505, which establishes the requirements for admissibility under the section, makes no reference to subsection (b), which establishes the notice requirement. this would indicate that compliance with the notice requirement is not a precondition of admissibility. subsection (b) also contains a requirement that the party opposing admission of a foreign record under 3505 must object before trial or otherwise waive the objection. this would indicate that the provisions of subsection (b) are meant to facilitate pretrial determinations of the admissibility of foreign records under 3505 rather than establish prerequisites to admissibility under the statute. the legislative history of 3505 bears out this conclusion.

59	"the thrust of the dissenting opinion's reasoning-that congress failed to ""enunciate[ ] with anything like the clarity required"" that it ""intended to totally overrule nobelman by allowing debtors with short-term mortgages to modify the amount of those mortgages through stripdown and bifurcation""-also rests on the absence of any discussion of overruling nobelman in section 1322(c)(2) 's legislative history. post at 174-75. congress typically enunciates an intent to overrule a particular judicial opinion in a statute's legislative history. see james buatti & richard l. hasen, conscious congressional overriding of the supreme court, gridlock, & partisan politics , 93 texas l. rev. see also 263, 276 (2014) (finding that between 1985 and 2011 ""unmentioned overrides"" of judicial statutory construction decisions-overrides in which a statute's legislative history did not expressly indicate an intent to override a judicial construction of a federal statute-typically constituted less than 25% of total congressional overrides, and never exceeded 35% of total congressional overrides); william n. eskridge, jr., overriding supreme court statutory interpretation decisions , 101 yale l.j. 331, 336-41 (1991). in accordance with that practice-and as witt correctly pointed out-the legislative history for the bankruptcy statute that enacted section 1322(c)(2) expressly identified numerous decisions congress intended to overrule. 113 f.3d at 513. thus, the ""clarity"" the dissent seeks would have been in the statute's legislative history. simply put, the dissenting opinion follows witt 's use of section 1322(c)(2) 's legislative history to try to create ambiguity in the statute's plain language."

61	in sum, the district court erroneously conflated federal authority and federal service, and misinterpreted the depart- ment of labor regulations binary between federal authority and state authority. userras discrimination provision does not turn on such distinctions since, by constructing title 32 activities under section 112 as full-time national guard duty, congress intended for muellers service to be covered by userra. we decline the invitation to carve out an excep- tion for section 112 counterdrug activities when there is no textual or public policy rationale to do so. iii. conclusion we conclude that the district court judge erred in its interpretation of userra and title 32 national guard service under section 112. the plain language of title 32 contemplates muellers service as full-time national guard duty, which userra explicitly covers. the judgment of the district court is therefore reversed and we remand for further proceed- ings consistent with this opinion, including the reinstatement of muellers state-law claim. 	Yes
62	we first look at the ordinary meaning of the fdcpas plain language to determine the meaning of consumer. see united states v. i.l., 614 f.3d 817, 820 (8th cir.2010). section 1692a(3) provides that [t]he term consumer means any natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt. 15 u.s.c. 1692a(3). as both parties correctly note, resolution of whether the plain language of 1692a(3)s consumer definition encompasses dun-ham, someone mistakenly contacted by a debt collector, turns on the proper reading of the phrase allegedly obligated to pay.

63	in our view, hews initial determinations of eligibility under part b are not binding upon the department of labor as final adjudications of eligibility. congress intended for all denied part b claims to be reviewed by dol under part c of the act where designated operators and the director would be provided with an opportunity to litigate the eligibility of the claimant and any liability for payments. director v. bethlehem mines corp., 669 f.2d 187, 195-97 (4th cir.1982); director v. forsyth energy, inc., 666 f.2d 1104, 1110-11 (7th cir.1981). see 124 cong.rec.s. 1443 (daily ed. feb. 7, 1978) (remarks of sen. randolph); reprinted in [the legislative history of the] black lung benefits reform act and the black lung benefits review act of 1977, house committee on education and labor, 96th cong., february 1979, at 902; 124 cong.rec.s. 1446 (daily ed. feb. 7, 1978) (remarks of sen. javits), reprinted in the legislative history, supra, at 908 (emphasis added). thus the boards interpretation of section 435(a)(2)(a) contravenes the stated intent of the 1977 amendment of the act and, as we note below, the plain language of the provision.

66	in our view, the ordinary meaning of the language used by this statute demonstrates that it requires the offense to be calculated, i.e., committed with the specific intent, to retaliate against government conduct, objectively defined. we reach this conclusion for two reasons. first, and chiefly, the statute expressly specifies that it is government conduct that the offense must be calculated to retaliate against. 18 u.s.c. 2332b(g)(5)(a) (emphasis added). we think the term government conduct, in conjunction with the rest of the statute, is most naturally read to mean conduct by government in the objective sense rather than to mean any kind of conducteven non-government conductthat a defendant believes to be conduct by government. 11 see united states v. black, 773 f.3d 1113, 1115 (10th cir	Yes

75	b & gs argument that section 932(1) is intended to apply only to the survivors of miners who suffer from complicated pneumoconiosis is unpersuasive. miners who are diagnosed with complicated pneumoconiosis without regard for the ppaca receive the benefit of an irrebuttable presumption that they are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and that their deaths were due to pneumoconiosis under 30 u.s.c. 921(c)(3). b & gs proposed reading would mean that amended section 932(1) did not have any effect inasmuch as the survivor of a miner who suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis never would have to file a new claim for benefits or revalidate the claim of the deceased miner because all miners who have been diagnosed with complicated pneumoconiosis automatically are presumed to have died from pneumoconiosis under section 921(c)(3). more importantly, nothing in the language of the statute limits section 932(1) to such a narrow scope of eligible survivors and nothing in the legislative history, or the history of the act itself, at least of which we are aware, supports b & gs position that the section applies only to the eligible survivors of miners who suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis.

80	in the case of sixty-five bedford, the fortrend acquisition vehicle swrr transferred $4.9 million to the trust in exchange for a company whose book value was only $3.9 million. after the transaction, swrr and sixty-five bedford merged. thus, the transaction left swrr/sixty-five bedford with approximately $5.9 million in cash assets, $4.9 million in debt to seap (another fortrend entity) and $2 million in tax liabilities. again, it is for the tax court to determine in the first instance whether swrr received reasonably equivalent value from the trust, and whether it was reasonably foreseeable that swrr/sixty-five bed-ford would not be able to satisfy future tax liabilities. and again, none of these determinations turns on the question of fraud in the traditional sense: a corporate transfer is fraudulent within the meaning of the uniform fraudulent transfer act, even if there is no fraudulent intent, if the corporation didnt receive reasonably equivalent value in return for the transfer and as a result was left with insufficient assets to have a reasonable chance of surviving indefinitely. crown stock distribution, 587 f.3d at 792.

81	second, and more significantly, henrik-son correctly observes that language in section 4042(b)(2), which describes the information the notification must contain, supports his interpretation of section 4042(b)(3). section 4042(b)(2)(b) requires disclosure of the prisoners criminal history, including a description of the offense of which the prisoner was convicted. clearly, congress intended offense of which the prisoner was convicted to refer to the current conviction, as it was obviously clarifying that it intended criminal history to include the current conviction. no other reading of section 4042(b)(2)(b) is reasonable. we agree with henrikson that the similar language in the next paragraph, section 4042(b)(3), if the prisoner was convicted of, also refers only to the current conviction.

82	". it is noteworthy that the district court has responsibility for these cases by assignment of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation, and we address this certified question in aid of the district court. this consolidated proceeding includes cases that were originally filed in various state and federal courts, raising state and federal antitrust claims. the state cases were first removed to federal district court and then transferred to the eastern district of michigan. in considering the issue of antitrust injury, the district court applied the same analysis, including the application of sixth circuit precedent, to all of the antitrust claims. id. at 645-58. as no party has taken issue with this approach, either before the district court or on appeal, we have followed the same path. we note, however, that although it is clear and undisputed that the state antitrust laws at issue all ""either follow federal sherman act precedent or find federal case law persuasive, hist. ct. op. ii, at 692 & n. 6 (citing state cases); see also state law pis. br. at 41-15, and that in a federal multi-district litigation there is a preference for applying the law of the transferee district, see in re temporomandibular joint (tmi) implants prod. liab. litig., 97 f.3d 1050 (8th cir.1996); menowitz v. brown, 991 f.2d 36 (2d cir.1993), it is not clear that precedent ""unique to a particular circuit and arguably divergent from the predominant interpretation of a federal law, such as the sixth circuits necessary predicate gloss on the antitrust injury doctrine, should be applied to state antitrust laws or federal antitrust claims that originated in other circuits, see in re korean air lines disaster of sept. 1, 1983, 829 f.2d 1171 (d.c.cir.1987), aff'd, 490 u.s. 122, 109 s.ct. 1676, 104 l.ed.2d 113 (1989) (law of transferor forum on federal question merits close consideration, but does not have stare decisis effect). as we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have alleged antitrust injury as contemplated by the sixth circuit, this consideration is of academic interest only. were the outcome otherwise, it might require further consideration."

84	but the borrowers-to-be rationale and the ministers interpretation of brazilian law are not one and the same, and the courts refusal to call one an act of state in no way implies rejection of the other. the ministers private letter ruling has three parts: the bare imperative, the borrowers-to-be rationale, and a broader discussion of the central banks legal situation in various types of financial transactions. the last of these is the likely antecedent for riggs iis reference to an interpretation of brazilian law which makes good sense when one notices that the borrowers-to-be rationale is not an interpretation of law at all. far from rejecting the borrowers-to-be logic, riggs ii in fact repeated that rationale indeed, restated the ministers order in such a way as to incorporate it immediately after disclaiming the ministers interpretation of brazilian law as an act of state: [wjhether or not it can be said that the brazilian minister of finances interpretation of brazilian law qualifies as an act of state ...

86	returning to the district courts use of the canons of statutory construction, we find its reliance on the canon ejusdem generis to lead to an erroneous interpretation of the statute. according to that canon, where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words. united states v. weadon, 145 f.3d 158, 160 (3d cir.1998). nevertheless, the district courts attempt to render forfeiture a more general term than penalty is strained and unconvincing. the alternative dictionary definitions of forfeiture which the district court cites span varying degrees of generality. although blacks dictionary characterizes forfeiture as a comprehensive term, it also defines it as a divestiture of specific propertylanguage which resembles that dictionarys alternative definitions of penalty in both its broadness and its specificity; penalty is an elastic term with many different shades of meaning but is nevertheless generally confined to pecuniary punishment. blacics law dictionary 650,1133 (6th ed. 1990).

88	' the compact evinces an intent that the agency does not waive its immunity in all other cases. it is thus unavailing to argue that 12 and 81 effected a broad waiver of eleventh amendment immunity when 80 makes so clear the limited nature of any such waiver. reliance solely upon the sue and be sued clause and the venue clause, as lizzi urges us to do, would be particularly inappropriate in this case because another section of the compact, 80, delineates the entire scope of wmatas waiver of its sovereign immunity. morris, 781 f.2d at 222 n. 3. lizzi cannot use the combination of 12 and 81 to create a waiver that 80 itself does not provide. indeed, it is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general. morales v. trans world airlines, inc., 504 u.s. 374, 384,112 s.ct. 2031, 119 l.ed.2d 157 (1992). finally, we agree with the d.c. circuit that nothing in the wmata compact purports to waive the agencys eleventh amendment immunity in all cases under federal law. see jones, 205 f.3d at 430; morris, 781 f.2d at 221. our reading of the compact is not only faithful to its language; it also renders circuit law consistent in the two federal circuits most likely to hear cases in which wmata is a party.

91	a statute is not ambiguous simply because one of its words is susceptible to two meanings. when interpreting a statute we must read it as a whole, as opposed to looking at single words in isolation, see united states v. morton, 467 u.s. 822, 828, 104 s.ct. 2769, 81 l.ed.2d 680 (1984), and doing so here goes a long way to resolving this controversy. valeros reading of the statute creates an unnecessary conflict. while congress left promotion up to judicial interpretation, it took care to define tax shelter by explicit reference to another section of the tax code. for purposes of the exception, a tax shelter is (i) a partnership or other entity, (ii) any investment plan or arrangement, or (iii) any other plan or arrangement, if a significant purpose of such partnership, entity, plan, or arrangement is the avoidance or evasion of federal income tax. 26 u.s.c. 6662(d)(2)(c)(ii). nothing in this definition limits tax shelters to cookie-cutter products peddled by shady practitioners or distinguishes tax shelters from individualized tax advice. instead, the language is broad and encompasses any plan or arrangement whose significant purpose is to avoid or evade federal taxes. see bdo iii, 492 f.3d at 823 (noting that the tax shelter exception is broad but such breadth does not make the text ambiguous). by advocating such a narrow definition of promotion, valero is, through the back door, proposing a definition of tax shelters at odds with the text of the statute. we decline to read such a contradiction into the statute. this definition of tax shelter is broad and could, as valero points out, include some legitimate attempts by a company to reduce its tax burden. but it is not our place to tinker with the unambiguous definition provided by congress. and even under this definition, tax shelters are not boundless. only plans and arrangements with a significant as opposed to an ancillary goal of avoiding or evading taxes count.

100	of course, this appeal coming directly from the district court falls within the scope of 28 u.s.c. 1291, a general appealability statute; this appeal does not arise under 28 u.s.c. 1293(b) (currently 28 u.s.c. 158(d)), which deals specifically with bankruptcy appeals, and which was at issue in in re saco local development corp., supra, and in re american colonial broadcasting corp., supra. we see no reason, however, for interpreting the word final in 1291 differently from the way we interpreted it in 1293(b) and 158(d). a.h. robins co. v. piccinin, 788 f.2d at 1009 (while section 1291 limits jurisdiction to appeals from all final decisions of the district courts, the concept of finality under such statute has traditionally been applied in a more pragmatic and less technical way in bankruptcy cases than in other situations. ); in re amatex corp., 755 f.2d at 1039 ([although our jurisdiction must be established under 1291, it is appropriate that our judgment in this regard be informed by notions of finality in bankruptcy appeals.); in re unr industries, inc., 725 f.2d at 1115 ([w]hile finality, interpreted functionally, might mean something different in a bankruptcy case from what it does in other cases, section 1291 is flexible enough to be applied differently depending on circumstances.); see also 16 c. wright, a. miller, e. cooper & e. gressman supra, at 71-72 (supp.1986) (reliance on 1291 need not lead to different finality results according to the circumstance whether the district court order was entered initially or on review of an order entered by a bankruptcy judge. whatever measure of distinctive analysis is appropriate to bankruptcy proceedings can be applied under 1291____). we conclude that the order is appealable.

101	initially, we note that hartford asserts no claim against magna or its collateral outside of the hen house bankruptcy proceeding. the nature and extent of the potential liability of magna, as an al lowed secured creditor in that bankruptcy proceeding, is established by the bankruptcy code; more particularly, it is established for purposes of this case by 506(c). despite arguments made by hartford asserting its 506(c) standing to surcharge property securing magnas claim based on other provisions of the bankruptcy code, the fact is that 506(c) is the only provision of the code that directly addresses the issue of standing that is before us. moreover, 506(c) is the only provision of the code that authorizes any party to a bankruptcy proceeding to recover from property securing the claim of an allowed secured creditor such as magna. it would be extremely odd were congress to have expanded the potential 506(c) liability of allowed secured creditors by means of the other code provisions put forward by hartford, which in one way or another deal with the assertion of claims against the bankruptcy estate, as distinguished from claims against the property of allowed secured creditors. we do not believe congress intended to do any such thing and, therefore, we focus on 506(c).

102	but the non-voip customer would be charged a total of $10.00 ($1.00 times 10 access lines), while the voip customer would have to pay $20.00 ($1.00 times 20 individual phone numbers) for the same concurrent outbound call capacity. as a result, if a customer switched from a non-voip telecommunications service to a voip one with the same concurrent outbound calling capacity and the same number of individual phone numbers, bellsouth asserted that such a customer would see its monthly telephone bill increase substantially. with that basic understanding, we return to the order the commission issued in response to the district courts referral. the usca11 case: 19-15072 date filed: 10/26/2021 page: 18 of 29 18 opinion of the court 19-15072 commissions order interpreted the 911 fee parity provision, 47 u.s.c. 615a-1(f)(1), to prohibit[] non-federal governmental enti- ties from imposing 911 fees or charges on voip services in any man- ner that would result in a subscriber to such voip services paying a total amount of 911 fees or charges that exceeds the total amount of 911 fees or charges that the same subscriber would pay for a tra- ditional telecommunications service with the same 911 outbound calling capability or same quantity of units upon which 911 fees are imposed for traditional telecommunications services. in other words, the oranges-to-oranges comparison the commissions interpretation of 615a-1(f)(1) requires is based on the unit of outbound concurrent calling capacityeffectively, the same ability to burden 911 services at any point in timenot the base fee. so under this construction, the number of phone num- bers a voip customer has is necessarily irrelevant to the maximum amount the voip customer may be charged if it is not possible for the voip customer to use all its phone numbers simultaneously to call 911. rather, both voip and non-voip customers may be charged the 911 fee for only as many numbers as they have the ability to simultaneously use to call 911. so voip and non-voip customers pay the same total 911 fee for the same maximum con- current call capacity, without respect to how the system is config- ured	No

107	the rla does not specify the statute of limitations applicable to a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation. in such situations we do not ordinarily assume that congress intended that there be no time limit on actions at all; rather, our task is to borrow the most suitable statute or other rule of timeliness from some other source. delcostello v. intl bhd. of teamsters, 462 u.s. 151, 158, 103 s.ct. 2281, 76 l.ed.2d 476 (1983). in delcostello, the supreme court borrowed-the six-month statute of limitations period in section 10(b) of the national labor relations act (nlra) and applied it to hybrid lawsuits, in which a party brings claims against both an employer and a union. id. at 169-72, 103 s.ct. 2281. an example of a hybrid lawsuit is one in which employees sues their employer alleging a breach of the collective bargaining agreement and sue the union alleging a breach of its duty of fair representation by mishandling the ensuing grievance or arbitration proceeding. id. at 170, 103 s.ct. 2281. our court extended delcostello by borrowing section 10(b)s six-month limitations for duty of fair representation claims where such claims directly implicated the collective bargaining relationship. phelan v. local 305 of united assn of journeymen, 973 f.2d 1050, 1060 (2d cir. 1992); see also haerum v. air line pilots assn, 892 f.2d 216, 219 (2d cir. 1989) (applying six-month limitations period to duty of fair representation claim based on the unions failure to file a grievance on, or renegotiate the issue of, pilot seniority). the district court here relied on haerum when it applied a six-month limitations period to plaintiffs claims without any further analysis, but haerum interpreted claims brought under labor management reporting and disclosure act (lmrda), 29 .u.s.c. 411 et. seq., which is not the statute at issue here.

108	other agencies charged with administering national programs face similar difficulties maintaining uniform interpretations of their laws in the face of disunity in the circuit courts that review their decisions. see peter l. strauss, one hundred fifty cases per year: some implications of the supreme courts limited resources for judicial review of agency action, 87 colum.l.rev. 1093, 1105-16 (1987). the tax court, for example, clearly seeks uniform national interpretation of the internal revenue code; its judgments are reviewed in regional courts of appeals, creating the possibility that taxes may vary across the circuits. 26 u.s.c. 7482(b). the tax court, like the ins, generally follows the law of the circuit in which the claim arose, and relies on a general self-correcting process to even out differences. golsen v. commissioner, 1970 wl 2191, 54 t.c. 742 (1970), aff'd, 445 f.2d 985 (10th cir.), cert. denied, 404 u.s. 940, 92 s.ct. 284, 30 l.ed.2d 254 (1971); see also strauss, one hundred fifty cases, at 1109-10; samuel estreicher and richard revesz, nonacquiescence by federal administrative agencies, 98 yale l.j. 679, 713-14 (1989). likewise, the social security administration seeks consistent application of the disability laws, although its decisions are reviewed by geographically diverse circuits. see estr-eieher & revesz, nonacquiescence, at 692-99.

110	epa reasons that, because it never wavered from region 6s initial determination that section 17 was indian country, the july 1997 letter and analysis cannot give rise to an independently reviewable determination. in its july 1997 letter and accompanying analysis, however, region 9 did not merely reiterate what region 6 had previously stated; nor did it issue a cursory reaffirmance or summary of region 6s prior position; it examined for the first time the legal precedent offered by nmed and hri, analyzed that precedent in light of the particular factual scenario at hand, and reasoned from its understanding of the facts and law that section 17 was indian country. a large portion of region 9s july 1997 analysis was devoted to discussing and distinguishing yazzie, 909 f.2d 1387, and watchman, 52 f.3d 1531, neither of which epa had addressed before, and the latter of which arose after region 6s initial 1993 tad decision. in short, region 9s july 14, 1997, determination marked the only time epa forthrightly examined all interested parties competing positions and issued an opinion analyzing the issue in significant depth. it was the culmination of what can be characterized either as region 9s independent determination regarding the indi-an country status of section 17, or as region 9s reexamination of section 17s status (as determined by nmeds request. because nmed petitioned for judicial review within 45 days of region 9s july 14, 1997, letter and analysis, this court has jurisdiction to review epas determination that section 17 is indian country. region 6) at	No

114	we begin, as we must, with the language of the statute. see lewis v. united states, 445 u.s. 55, 60, 100 s.ct. 915, 63 l.ed.2d 198 (1980). the parameters of section 201(c) are set forth in the three clauses just noted. under ordinary principles of statutory construction, the second clause must be read in the context of the first and third clauses. see general elec. co. v. occupational safety & health review commn, 583 f.2d 61, 64-65 (2d cir.1978) (the meaning of one term may be determined by reference to the terms it is associated with citing 2a sutherland, statutory construction 47.16 (noscitur a sociis), 47.17 (ejusdem generis ) (4th ed.1973)); see also se curities & exch. commn v. national sec., inc., 393 u.s. 453, 466, 89 s.ct. 564, 21 l.ed.2d 668 (1969) (the meaning of particular phrases must be determined in context.) (citation omitted). the first clause sets the floor, so to speak, of the presumptive privilege: the collective-work author is permitted to reproduce and distribute individual contributions as part of that particular collective work. in this context, that particular collective work means a specific edition or issue of a periodical. see 17 u.s.c. 201(c). the second clause expands on this, to permit the reproduction and distribution of the individual contribution as part of a revision of that collective work, i.e., a revision of a particular edition of a specific periodical. finally, the third clause sets the outer limit or ceiling on what the publisher may do; it permits the reproduction and distribution of the individual contribution as part of a later collective work in the same series, such as a new edition of a dictionary or encyclopedia.

115	the office of section 362(h) is not to redress tort violations but to protect the rights conferred by the automatic stay. if one creditor muscled out the others in violation of the stay, the bankruptcy court would impose monetary sanctions under subsection (h). if the defendant here had intimidated the debtor into giving up her right of discharge, the bankruptcy court would have ordered under the authority of the same subsection the monetary relief necessary to restore her to the financial position she would have occupied had the defendant not resorted to intimidation. the interest in judicial economy, as embodied in the clean-up doctrine of equity, wal-mart stores, incorporated associates health & welfare plan v. wells, 213 f.3d 398, 400-01 (7th cir.2000); medtronic, inc. v. intermedics, inc., 725 f.2d 440, 442 (7th cir.1984); mowbray v. mosely, hallgarten, estabrook & weeden, inc., 795 f.2d 1111, 1114 (1st cir.1986); 1 dan b. dobbs, dobbs on the law of remedies: damages-equity-restitution 2.7, pp. 180-81 (2d ed.1993), might allow the court to top off relief designed to redress any financial injury inflicted by the violation of the automatic stay with an award of damages for incidental harms, perhaps including emotional distress if adequately proved, to spare the debtor from having to bring two suits. fleet mortgage may have been such a case, since the misconduct of the defendant in violating the automatic stay imposed substantial legal costs on the plaintiff, which are not alleged here. no financial injury is alleged in this case, and we do not think that emotional injury is compensable under section 362(h) when there is no financial loss to hitch it to by means of the clean-up doctrine.

117	the conduct of which harper complains, imposing a condition that resale be overseas and demanding assurances in the form of a customer list, was not discrimination with respect to delivery services; rather, it was a refusal to go forward unconditionally with a sale. it was a breach of the contract of sale, if anything. section 2(e) requires that the service of delivery itself be made available to purchasers on proportionally equal terms. it does not require that all conditions precedent to a delivery be identical in every transaction in like goods sold for resale. as the gravamen of harpers complaint is discrimination with respect to a term of sale not itself a service within the meaning of 2(e), harper may not bring its case within the subsection by employing the label delivery.

120	barclays contends, in essence, that when it agreed to the terms of the engagement letter, it anticipated that asarco would be making a quick stop in chapter 11. to analogize, barclays apparently thought that it had a dusty, yet functional, corvette on its hands. although it needed a little polish, this corvette was poised for a speedy trip into and out of chapter 11 with the help of an experienced driver, ie., barclays. once in the drivers seat, however, barclays realized that the corvette needed far more than a car wash. the dust was nothing compared to the disarray that it discovered under the hood. assuming, arguendo, that barclays did not know that asarco had more serious problems, we nevertheless conclude that it could have and should have anticipated, within the meaning of 328(a), that a company in need of a chapter 11 reorganization might have latent problems lurking under its hood. cf in re home express, inc., 213 b.r. 162, 165 (bankr.n.d.cal. 1997) ([b]ad management is too often the norm in chapter 11 cases.). it is foreseeable that such problems, once discovered, could transform what was expected to be a pit-stop into a lengthy reorganization process, requiring considerably more work than was initially expected.

121	i respectfully dissent. i certainly agree that when congress enacted section 1359, it intended to limit the statutes application to persons whose ancestry is 50 per cen-tum of blood of the american indian race. so much is clear from the face of the statute. understood literally, the statute would require anyone seeking to come within its protections to prove that at least half of his or her forebears were living on this continent before columbus arrived. the majority opinion holds that section 1359 requires some combination of evidence from which the finder of fact can reasonably conclude that the individual in fact possesses 50 per centum or more american indian blood. proof only that an individual possess some unidentifiable degree of indian blood without more will be insufficient. in this case, curnews expert admitted that she could not reasonably state that curnew possessed fifty percent american indian blood. she was quite candid and fair in stating the obvious. the majority concludes that unless she could state such an opinion within a reasonable degree of certainty as an expert, she would not be able to testify.

123	as written, 2255 clearly provides a statutory means by which an individual under federal sentence can obtain federal habeas corpus review of the sentence imposed. as has been emphasized by the supreme court, congress enacted 2255 to provide in the sentencing court a remedy exactly commensurate with that which had previously been available by habeas corpus in the court of the district where the prisoner was confined. hill v. united states, 368 u.s. 424, 427, 82 s.ct. 468, 471, 7 l.ed.2d 417 (1962). see generally united states v. hayman, 342 u.s. 205, 72 s.ct. 263, 96 l.ed. 232 (1952). pursuant to 2255, individuals sentenced by a federal court can attack the sentence imposed by claiming one of four different grounds: (1) that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states; (2) that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence; (3) that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law; and (4) that the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack. hill, 368 u.s. at 426-27, 82 s.ct. at 470 (quotation omitted).

127	merlo also asserts that a substantial risk of forfeiture exists because article 8 of the uniform commercial code and 10(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934 give exodus the right to bring suit for disgorgement of profits. without reaching the issue of whether those statutes bestow such rights on exodus, we conclude that this argument also fails. section 83(c)(3) provides that a substantial risk of forfeiture exists, and the property becomes nontransferable within the meaning of 83, when a sale of the property would subject an individual to suit under 16(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934 for disgorgement of profit against certain corporate insiders. i.r.c. 83(c). merlo does not contend that he was an executive to which 16(b) applied, but instead argues that, by analogy, a substantial risk of forfeiture exists whenever an employer or third party has the right to compel the disgorgement of the profits from the sale of the property.

128	the principle on which the [ex post facto] clause is based the notion that persons have a right to fair warning of that conduct which will give rise to criminal penalties is fundamental to our concept of constitutional liberty. as such, that right is protected against judicial action by the due process clause of the fifth amendment. in bouie v. city of columbia, 378 u.s. 347[, 353-54, 84 s.ct. 1697, 1702-03, 12 l.ed.2d 894] (1964), a case involving the cognate provision of the fourteenth amendment, the court reversed trespass convictions, finding that they rested on an unexpected construction of the state trespass statute by the state supreme court:	No

130	having considered the policy objections, we cannot conclude that our construction of the code leads to an impractical and illogical holding that ignores the realities of the bankruptcy process. e.g., in re leydet, 150 b.r. at 644. for certain, we cannot conclude that the result we reach through statutory construction is absurd or futile. while reasonable people may disagree over the balance congress has struck between countervailing interests under the current statutory scheme, because we find that statutory directive to be clear and because it does not lead to an absurd result, under well-established principles of statutory interpretation we must enforce it.

131	the secretary defends the agencys decision not to classify family practice grants as seed money grants not so much by disagreeing with the contentions made by memorial (although she does disagree with memorials assertion that the third characteristic exists ), as by pointing out a distinction memorial failed to make. the secretary asserts that section 612.2 has consistently been interpreted by the agency to apply only to grants for services, rather than to training grants, and that family practice grants are training grants not covered by section 612.2.

132	the facts of central hudson, however, demonstrate that, as applicable here, it decided no more than that epa was not acting outside its authority in retaining jurisdiction over the issuing authority for certain permits. in that case, the epa was in the process of issuing discharge permits to the plaintiffs. in the interim period between the original application to epa and final issuance of a permit, the epa approved the status of the new york state department of environmental conservation as an issuing authority for discharge permits. the clean water act provided that once a state program received state approval, the epa must cease issuing permits. see 33 u.s.c. 1342(c)(1). the epa had interpreted this section to mean that no new applications would be accepted by the epa, but that it could complete any pending applications. thus the very narrow question presented to the court of appeals was whether applications pending with the epa at the time approval was given to the new york state department of environmental conservation must be turned over to the jurisdiction of the state agency. the court first found that this was not agency action described in 1369(b)(1) and thus was not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals. thus, the court decided the case was properly brought in the district court. the court went on to hold that prompt and efficient accomplishment of the clean water acts objectives would not be accomplished by transferring permitting authority to the state where the process was nearing completion in the epa, and that epa had properly retained jurisdiction.

133	shlahtichman makes a belated argument that construing the truncation provision not to apply to email receipts is inconsistent with the fcras preemption provision, 15 u.s.c. 1681t(b). that provision forecloses regulation by the states of any conduct regulated by the individual provisions of the statute, including the truncation provision. see 1681t(b)(5)(a). shlahtichman reasons that if email receipts are not covered by the federal statute, then states will be free to impose their own truncation requirements on email receipts, producing the very crazy quilt of state laws that fcras preemption provision was meant to avoid. but shlahtichman forfeited this argument by failing to make it in the district court, e.g., ocean atlantic dev. corp. v. aurora christian schools, inc., 322 f.3d 983, 1005 (7th cir.2003), and this is not one of the rare civil cases in which we might overlook the forfeiture, see russian media group, llc v. cable am., inc., 598 f.3d 302, 308 (7th cir.2010).

134	new mexicos statute of limitations for wrongful death actions is no exception. the new mexico supreme court has held that the statute is not only a limitation on the remedy but also on the right to institute such an action. wall v. gillett, 61 n.m. 256, 298 p.2d 939, 940 (1956) (citations omitted). see also perry v. staver, 81 n.m. 766, 769, 473 p.2d 380, 383 (1970) (suggesting that new mexico follows the general rule applicable to wrongful death actions, namely, that limitations provisions in wrongful death statutes are not properly statutes of limitations as that term is generally understood, but they are qualifications and conditions restricting the rights granted by the statutes, and must be strictly complied with ) (quoting annot., 67 a.l.r. 1070 (1930)). as such, new mexicos wrongful death statute of limitations is part of the states substantive law, and the district court correctly concluded that it governed sonjas public liability claim on behalf of kimberlys estate. cf. levinson v. deupree, 345 u.s. 648, 651, 73 s.ct. 914, 916, 97 l.ed.2d 1319 (1953) (a time limitation deemed attached to the right of action created by the state is binding in the federal forum) (citing western fuel co. v. garcia, 257 u.s. at 242, 42 s.ct. at 90, and the harrisburg, 119 u.s. at 214, 7 s.ct. at 147) (all admiralty cases).

137	gadelhak has one last card to play: he insists that con_ gress blessed his interpretation of the statute when it amended the act in 2015. at that time, the d.c. circuit had not yet struck down the 2015 fcc order interpreting the stat_ ute in gadelhaks favor. gadelhak asserts that congress es_ sentially ratified that interpretation when it amended the stat_ ute in 2015 to add an exception for government debt collection and declined to amend the definition in any other respect. see pub. l. no. 114_74, 301, 129 stat. 584, 588 (2015). we reject 16 no. 19_1738 this argument, as has every circuit to consider it. see glasser, 2020 wl 415811, at *6 (collecting cases). congressional failure to act does not necessarily reflect approval of the status quo	No
138	it might be thought, and indeed firstsouth argues, that this contention is foreclosed by the stipulation of the parties that the loan was secured by a first lien on residential real property. on the other hand, the stipulation could, we suppose, be read simply as an agreement that the property was residential in fact, that is, that structures in which people lived, or were to live, had been built on it, thus leaving open the question of law whether the property was residential as that term is used in section 501(a)(1)(a). as a rule, stipulations are not considered binding as to issues of law, and it is conceivable that even a word like residential, which has a well-understood meaning in the world, as opposed to in court, might have been used by congress as a term of art.

139	because this definition uses the words shall include, rather than the words shall mean, which appear in other definitions, the supreme court read this language to expand not to restrict the meaning of person. american surety co. of new york v. marotta, 287 u.s. 513, 517, 53 s.ct. 260, 261, 77 l.ed. 466 (1933). citing its interpretation of person includes ... in 1(23), the court held that l(ll)s definition of creditor creditor includes . . . comprehended a surety even though the suretys liability is contingent and sureties are not mentioned in 1(11). we believe that, although land trusts are not expressly mentioned as persons, the statute should not be read to exclude them. as the statute provides no further specific indication as to the meaning of the word person, we should give weight to the general purposes of the bankruptcy act. bankruptcy legislation has two purposes: debtor relief, see united states v. kras, 409 u.s. 434, 448-49, 93 s.ct. 631, 639-40, 34 l.ed.2d 626 (1973), and equity among creditors, see young v. higbee co., 324 u.s. 204, 210 & n.8, 65 s.ct. 594, 597 & n.8, 89 l.ed. 890 (1945). the first purpose is clearly served by permitting land trust no. 2 to operate in bankruptcy court. even in liquidation proceedings, the act allows the debtor or his trustee to proceed without harassment. see matter of natl hospital & institutional bldrs. co., 658 f.2d 39, 44 (2d cir. 1981). compass has tried to deprive the debtor of possession and control of the hotels through state court litigation; even in bankruptcy proceedings, compass has objected to the debtors efforts to lease an unproductive wing of the barcelona hotel for $275,000 per year plus a percentage of profits.

140	on the question of the dischargeability of zentzs debt under section 523(a)(5), the district court reversed. it reasoned that it is a question of law whether attorneys fees incurred by an ex-spouse in post-dissolution proceedings regarding visitation and custody of a child is a nondischargeable debt under 11 u.s.c. 523(a)(5). adams v. zentz, 127 b.r. 444 (w.d.mo.1991) (order reversing decision and remanding case to bankruptcy court) [hereinafter district courts order], reprinted in appellants app. 24, 29. accordingly, upon de novo review, the court found that zentzs debt to adams is in the nature of support, and therefore nondischargeable, because: (1) a majority of other bankruptcy courts have found attorneys fees incurred in child custody litigation to be in the nature of support; (2) missouri law defines custody and visitation rights in terms of the best interests of the child, and it is reasonable to conclude ... that attorneys fees awarded to a parent [pursuing the best interests of the child] constitute an inseparable element of the childs support, id. at 448, reprinted in appellants app. at 32; (3) [application of] 523(a)(5) only to debts arising from the direct financial support of a child is an unrealistic and overly narrow construction of the statute, id. at 448, reprinted in appellants app. at 32-33; and (4) here the attorneys fees are indirectly related to the financial support of terri lynn. id. at 448, reprinted in appellants app. at 33. zentz appeals the decision of the district court.

141	the bush courts reasoning applies with undiminished force in the case at hand. the relevant inquiry must concentrate on whether the judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed. abbasi, 137 s.ct. at 1857-58. in the context of this case, the careful layering of federal statutes, including the csra and title vii, involves a wide range of policy considerations best left to congresss superior understanding of governmental structures and systems nationwide. see id. at 1858; see also bush, 462 u.s. at 389, 103 s.ct. 2404 (not only has congress developed considerable familiarity with balancing governmental efficiency and the rights of employees, but it also may inform itself through factfinding procedures such as hearings that are not available to the courts.).	No
142	class actions are specifically addressed in the section of the tila relating to damages. see 15 u.s.c. 1640(a)(2)(b). there is, however, no comparable mention of the class-action mechanism in the section that deals with rescission. see id. 1635. we long have recognized that, under ordinary circumstances, the inclusion of a specific provision in one part of a statute and the exclusion of the same sort of provision in another part of the same statute should be treated as deliberate. see united states v. green, 407 f.3d 434, 443 (1st cir.2005). consequently, the variation in the treatment of class actions in the two relevant sections of the tila strongly suggests that congress did not intend to include a class-action mechanism within the compass of section 1635. see id.; see also duncan v. walker, 533 u.s. 167, 173, 121 s.ct. 2120, 150 l.ed.2d 251 (2001) (applying this principle of statutory construction in an analogous context).

143	the government nonetheless contends that quorum rules ordinarily define the number of members that is both necessary and sufficient for an entity to take an action. brief for respondent 20. therefore, because of the quorum provision, if at least two members of a delegee group actually participate in a decision . . . that should be the end of the matter, regardless of vacancies in the group or on the board. ibid. but even if quorum provisions ordinarily provide the rule for dealing with vacancies i. e., even if they ordinarily make irrelevant any vacancies in the remainder of the larger body the quorum provisions in 3(b) do no such thing. rather, there is a separate clause addressing vacancies. the vacancy clause, recall, provides that [a] vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board. 153(b) (2006 ed.). we thus understand the quorum provisions merely to define the number of members who must participate in a decision, and look to the vacancy clause to determine whether vacancies in excess of that number have any effect on an entitys authority to act.

144	". despite the guidelines clear instructions, maloney claims that the relevant provisions are ambiguous, and that we should resolve this ambiguity in his favor in accordance with the rule of lenity. see united states v. simpson, 319 f.3d 81, 86 (2d cir.2002) (holding that rule of lenity, providing that ambiguities in criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of defendants, applies to the guidelines). his claim of ambiguity relies entirely on the amendments to 2jl.ls application notes. note 3 now provides that the two-point enhancement under 2b 1.1 (b)(7)(c) will ordinarily apply in cases ""involving violation of a judicial order enjoining fraudulent behavior. application note 2, which pertains to violations of 18 u.s.c. 228, contains no analogous statement. maloney claims that this omission from note 2, when considered in conjunction with note 3, creates ambiguity as to whether the two-point enhancement applies to violations of child support obligations. we disagree. the omission cited by maloney is just that: an omission. there is no language in the guidelines or relevant statutes that negates or undermines the meaning of other applicable (and unambiguous) guidelines provisions most importantly, 1b1.5. the rule of lenity therefore does not apply. see united states v. canales, 91 f.3d 363, 367-68 (2d cir.1996) (""the rule [of lenity] is inapplicable unless 'after a court has seize[d][on] every thing from which aid can be derived, it is still left with an ambigupty].

145	the question whether the two overt acts should have been stricken (divorced from the question whether proof of those acts at trial should have been barred) does not satisfy the requirement that the right at issue in a collateral order appeal must be jurisprudentially important, ie., sufficiently important to overcome the policies militating against interlocutory appeals. santtini, 963 f.2d at 592 (quoting lauro lines s.r.l. v. chasser, 490 u.s. 495, 502, 109 s.ct. 1976, 1980, 104 l.ed.2d 548 (1989) (scalia, j., concurring)). see also digital equipment corp., u.s. at -, 114 s.ct. at 1995-96; nemours found. v. manganaro corp., 878 f.2d 98, 100 (3d cir.1989); praxis properties, 947 f.2d at 56. as we have noted, striking these overt acts would not require the dismissal of any charge in the indictment. in addition, neither retention of these overt acts in the indictment nor their removal would in itself have any evidentiary significance. as juries are customarily instructed, the indictment is not evidence. retention of these overt acts in the indictment does not necessarily mean that the prosecution will attempt or will be permitted to prove them at trial. similarly, the absence of these overt acts from the indictment would not in itself preclude the prosecution from proving them or from relying on such proof to satisfy the overt act requirement contained in 18 u.s.c. 371. accordingly, the asserted right to have the two overt acts stricken before trial (or to have a hearing on that question), far from being important, appears to have little significance.

148	were there evidence of systemic violation by the bia of its regulations, this would be a different case. we would then have to face, inter alia, the inss claim that the decision to streamline an immigration appeal is not reviewable by the courts because these are matters committed to agency discretion. but see abbott labs. v. gardner, 387 u.s. 136, 140, 87 s.ct. 1507, 18 l.ed.2d 681 (1967) (presumption of reviewability of agency actions), abrogated in part by califano v. sanders, 430 u.s. 99, 105, 97 s.ct. 980, 51 l.ed.2d 192 (1977) (holding that the apa is not to be interpreted as an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction over agency decisions); goncalves v. reno, 144 f.3d 110, 127 (1st cir.1998), cert. denied, 526 u.s. 1004, 119 s.ct. 1140, 143 l.ed.2d 208 (1999) (upholding judiciarys role in determining whether an agencys interpretation of a statute is permissible); cf. saakian v. ins, 252 f.3d 21, 25-27 (1st cir.2001)(remanding case where bia failed to apply its own rules). we are not willing, however, in the absence of such evidence, to infer from these numbers alone that the required review is not taking place. courts themselves use summary affirmance or summary disposition procedures in which parties may receive one-line dispositions of their appeals. see, e.g., 1st cir. r. 27.1. these are workload management devices that acknowledge the reality of high caseloads. they do not, either alone or in combination with caseload statistics, establish that the required review is not taking place.

149	the parties also dispute the effect of the filing of a motion to dismiss for violation of the speedy trial act. to settle this dispute we need look no further than the explicit language of section 3161(h)(1)(f), which excludes the period during the pend-ency of any motion. a motion to dismissregardless of the grounds upon which it is basedis a motion like any other motion, and thus falls within the express exclusion of (f). see furlow v. united states, 644 f.2d 764, 768 (9th cir.) (district court was clearly correct in ruling that period between the filing of a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution and its disposition is excludable under (f); in reaching this conclusion, the appellate court relied only on the express language of that section), cert. denied, 454 u.s. 871, 102 s.ct. 340, 70 l.ed.2d 175 (1981); united states v. hencye, 505 f.supp. 968, 972 n. 3 (n.d.fla.1981) (dictum). but cf. united states v. new buffalo amusement corp., 600 f.2d 368, 375 (2d cir.1979) (motion to dismiss does not toll 180 day period under rules 5(a)(1) and 7(a)(1) of interim western district of new york plan). moreover, neither party points us to any other provision of the statute or any statement in its legislative history suggesting a contrary interpretation. nevertheless, appellee graham urges that we adopt a rule of non-exclusion on policy grounds, arguing that excluding time for filing dismissal motions would penalize defendants for attempting to assert their rights. of course, if the 70 day period has in fact expired at the time the motion to dismiss is filed, whether or not it stops the clock does not matter. graham suggests that a defendant concerned about the rule of barker v. wingo, 407 u.s. 514, 92 s.ct. 2182, 33 l.ed.2d 101 (1972), and united states v. herman, 576 f.2d 1139 (5th cir.1978)which requires that courts consider, among other things, the timeliness of a defendants speedy trial claim in assessing its meritsmay seek to assert his speedy trial act claim before the 70 day period has run, thus effectively postponing or precluding altogether the accrual of 70 non-excludable days. yet this overlooks the fact that barker and herman involved claims to a speedy trial under the constitution, not claims under the speedy trial act. the difference is important. under the act, a defendant may if he wishes postpone asserting a speedy trial motion to dismiss until just before trial. 18 u.s.c.a. 3162(a)(2). using this procedure, defendants uncertain as to the validity of their claims under the act can avoid stopping the clock. we also question the wisdom of forcing the government to expend the time and resources of trying a defendant whose indictment may be dismissed. but the most important reason for rejecting grahams policy argument has nothing to do with our view of the strength of the policy arguments for or against a rule of non-exclusion. policy choices are for congress to make. in the case of this issue, congress has already made them. the wording of the act clearly requires exclusion.

150	the supreme court raised doubts about this holding of wood in jones v. united states, 526 u.s. 227, 119 s.ct. 1215, 143 l.ed.2d 311 (1999). in interpreting the federal carjacking statute, 18 u.s.c. 2119 (1994 & supp. iv 1998), the court concluded that the statute was ambiguous as to whether an increased penalty for serious bodily injury during a carjacking was a sentencing factor or an element of a different, more serious, substantive offense. citing the rule of constitutional doubt, the court held that serious bodily injury was an element of a different substantive crime. interpreting the statute otherwise, the court said, the statute would run afoul of the principle that any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for k crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. jones, 526 u.s. at 243 n. 6, 119 s.ct. 1215. while noting that prior eases suggest rather than establish this principle, id., the court concluded that it was required to interpret the statute to avoid the constitutional question.

151	. malice aforethought is a concept that originated with the common law and is used in 18 u.s.c. 1111(a) in its common law sense. see stevenson, supra, 162 u.s. at 320, 16 s.ct. at 841. the statutes terms, since known to and derived from the common law, are referable to it for interpretation. united states v. pardee, 368 f.2d 368, 374 (4 cir.1966). accordingly, we do not confine our consideration of the precedents to decisions of federal courts interpreting the federal statute, but rather consider other sources which may shed light on the issues of this case.	No
152	we therefore cannot accept the district courts interpretation of the 1959 act as ratifying the 1840 treaty. the act does not expressly ratify it. there also is no mention of the 1760 and 1763 treaties, by which the tribe received the 144,000 acres in issue. thus, the district courts construction of the act is contrary to the requirement that congressional intent to terminate a treaty reservation must be clear. see decoteau v. district county court, 420 u.s. 425, 444, 95 s.ct. 1082, 1092, 43 l.ed.2d 300 (1975).

153	appellants argue that there is generally an implied right of contribution among joint tortfeasors which should apply to the lanham act, citing three securities cases: sirota v. solitron devices, inc., 673 f.2d 566, 578 (2d cir.), cert. denied, 459 u.s. 838, 103 s.ct. 86, 74 l.ed.2d 80 (1982); tucker v. arthur andersen, 646 f.2d 721, 727 n. 7 (2d cir.1981); stowell v. ted s. finkel inv. servs., 641 f.2d 323, 325 (5th cir.), rehg denied, 647 f.2d 1123, (1981). there is no federal common law of contribution, even though there are a few instances where federal common law has been formulated when necessary to protect uniquely federal interests. texas indus. v. radcliff materials, inc., 451 u.s. 630, 640, 101 s.ct. 2061, 2067, 68 l.ed.2d 500 (1981), quoting banco nacional de cuba v. sabbatino, 376 u.s. 398, 426, 84 s.ct. 923, 939, 11 l.ed.2d 804 (1964). the securities statutes at issue in the cases relied upon by appellants provide for specific rights of contribution, see texas indus., 451 u.s. at 640 n. 11, 101 s.ct. at 2066 n. 11, whereas the trademark statute at issue here does not.

154	in august of 1992, hurricane andrew caused extensive damage to centurys platforms in the gulf. a year later, it filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code. the united states then filed a proof of claim for $1,855,004, the full royalty that would be due on production worth $12,250,000, the amount of enrons lump sum payment. in this adversary proceeding, the united states and century each filed motions for summary judgment. the bankruptcy court ruled in centurys favor across the board, holding that the. governments royalty claim exceeded its statutory authority, and that the governments interpretation of the gross proceeds rule was arbitrary and capricious, unlawfully retroactive, and adopted in violation of the administrative procedure acts notice and comment requirement. the district court affirmed on all grounds except the last.

155	on appeal to the bap, busseto argued that 502(h) reinstated its claim against laizure after busseto paid the settlement of the trustees claim. however, the bap, in affirming the bankruptcy court, concluded that 502(h) does not permit busseto to reinstate! ] its claim against the debtor once it paid the settlement of the trustees claim. busseto foods, inc. v. laizure {in re laizure), 349 b.r. 604, 607 (9th cir. bap 2006). the bap emphasized that it read the relevant statutes to say that, under 502(h), busseto could bring a claim against the estate but not the debtor. id.

156	the concept of sovereign immunity means that the united states cannot be sued without its consent. merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith, inc. v. jacks, 960 f.2d 911, 913 (10th cir.1992). such consent may be found only when congress unequivocally expresses its intention to waive the governments sovereign immunity in the statutory text. united states v. murdock mach. & engg co., 81 f.3d 922, 930 (10th cir.1996) (quotation omitted). in cases concerning the united states title to real property, the supreme court has construed the quiet title act as a waiver of sovereign immunity providing the exclusive means for challenging such title. mottaz, 476 u.s. at 842, 106 s.ct. 2224 (quoting block v. north dakota, 461 u.s. 273, 286, 103 s.ct. 1811, 75 l.ed.2d 840 (1983)).

157	". we thus reject a contrary view of constitutional interpretation advanced in a recent dissent to a sixth circuit decision concerning an amendment to the flsa, the equal pay act. see timmer, 104 f.3d at 845-47 (boggs, j., concurring in part and dissenting in part). the dissent's author explained that he could not agree that congress' ""exclusive invocation of only one source of power was not only unnecessary, but completely irrelevant. id. at 846. ""if that were the case, he contended, ""then any such statement ... would always be mere surplusage and a court would always be free to rummage through the constitution to find some clause that the court thinks might support the exercise of power. id. while the reasoning in the timmer dissent has some surface appeal, we choose not to embrace it in light of the contrary supreme court and first circuit precedent that we consider above. see wyoming, 460 u.s. at 243-44 n. 18, 103 s.ct. at 1064 n. 18; woods, 333 u.s. at 144, 68 s.ct. at 424; ramirez, 715 f.2d at 698."

158	the case before us does involve, however, the corporations exercise of its discretion not to bring an enforcement action. as such, it is a matter exclusively within the corporations discretion and beyond the power of judicial review. congress gave the corporation the sole authority to insure the compliance of recipients and their employees with the provisions of the [act] and the rules, regulations, and guidelines promulgated pursuant to [the act].... 42 u.s.c.a. 2996e(b)(l)(a). the available methods of enforcing the act include the possible suspension of funding and/or suspension of the employees found to have violated the act and, after proper notice and hearing, the termination of funding or the termination of the , employees found to have violated the act, as deemed appropriate for the violation in question. 42 u.s.c.a. 2996e(b)(5). by their terms, the statutory enforcement provisions permit, but do not compel, the corporation to sanction violations of the act or of the corporations regulations. see 42 u.s.c.a. 2996e(b)(5); see also 45 c.f.r. 1618.5(a) (requiring corporation to investigate allegations of non-compliance promptly and attempt to resolve [them] through informal consultation with the recipient); 45 c.f.r. 1618.5(b) (giving corporation discretion to suspend or terminate funding after attempts at infor mal resolution have been unsuccessful). congress has committed the enforcement power to the corporations discretion, and it is therefore not within the courts power to review. chaney, 470 u.s. at 831, 105 s.ct. 1649 ([a]n agencys decision not to prosecute or enforce ... is a decision generally committed to an agencys absolute discretion.).

159	we are mindful that the exceptions spelled out in 2283 are narrow and are not [to] be enlarged by loose statutory construction. chick kam choo, 486 u.s. at 146, 108 s.ct. at 1689 (quoting atlantic coast line r.r., 398 u.s. at 287, 90 s.ct. at 1743). in keeping with this admonishment, we find guidance in federal rule of civil procedure 54(a), which defines judgment for use in the federal rules as a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. this definition encompasses interlocutory rulings that are appealable as of right, like preliminary injunctions, in addition to final judgments on the merits. 17 charles a. wright et al., federal practice and procedure 4426, at 550 (2d ed. 1988). in our view, [rule 54(a)s definition of judgment] give[s] a workable and coherent interpretation to 2283. id.; baker, 415 f.supp. at 1249. we thus conclude a preliminary injunction is a protectable judgment under the relitigation exception in 2253.

160	basically the question before us is whether the statute requires all . . stock acquired ... to have been acquired only (solely) for stock, or whether it is sufficient if a minimum of (at least) 80 per cent . . was acquired for stock even though the remainder . . was . acquired for a consideration other than stock . . . we recognize that there is force to petitioners argument that the practical objectives of the statute might well be satisfied if we were to adopt the construction urged. we think, however, that the authorities have clearly established the applicable rule of law to be that'the consideration for whatever stock is acquired by the transferee corporation in a transaction such as that before us must be solely the transferees voting stock, and nothing else.	No
161	the difference between my interpretation of the statute and the courts becomes transparent by considering this example. suppose the hunters to whom hughes had offered or provided guiding, outfitting, or other services had been unsuccessful in bagging a deer. in that ease there would be no market value of a particular deer for the jury to consider, only the price of the unlawful hunt. hughes would nevertheless still be guilty of violating the lacey act because [i]t is deemed to be a sale of fish or wildlife in violation of this chapter for a person for money or other consideration to offer or provide ... guiding, outfitting, or other services. 16 u.s.c. 3372(c)(1). and hughes would be guilty of a felony level violation of the lacey act so long as that specific type of prohibited sale of fish or wildlife had a market value in excess of $350. 16 u.s.c. 3373(d)(1)(b).	No
162	we recognize that burgin v. office of pers. mgmt., 120 f.3d 494 (4th cir.1997), held otherwise, refusing to defer to opms interpretation of a contract because contract interpretation is a question of law clearly within the competence of courts. id. at 498. given that burgin is contrary to the fourth circuits earlier decision in caudill v. blue cross & blue shield, 999 f.2d 74, 79-80 (4th cir.1993) (deferring to opm interpretation of health-benefit contracts), overruled on other grounds by empire healthchoice assurance, inc. v. mcveigh, 547 u.s. 677, 683, 689, 126 s.ct. 2121, 165 l.ed.2d 131 (2006), it is unclear whether it is controlling even in that circuit. see mcmellon v. united states, 387 f.3d 329, 333 (4th cir.2004) (en banc) (when published panel opinions are in direct conflict on a given issue, the earliest opinion controls.). but in any event, we do not find burgin persuasive. it ignores opms experience and expertise as well as the statutory scheme that gives opm the primary and principal role of interpreting health-plan contracts with federal employees.

163	deductions are matters of legislative grace, existing by virtue of specific legislation, and a taxpayer claiming the benefits of a deduction must point to the applicable statutory authority and show that he or she comes within its terms. new colonial ice company, inc. v. helvering, 292 u.s. 435, 440, 54 s.ct. 788, 790, 78 l.ed.2d 1348 (1934). the provision invoked by taxpayers in the district court is 162(a) of the internal revenue- code of 1954 (26 u.s.c. 162(a)) that permits a deduction for the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business. section 162(a)(2) specifically includes within the meaning of ordinary and necessary business expenses the cost of traveling, including the entire amount expended for meals, while away from home in pursuit of a trade or business, but this section only applies where the taxpayer is away from home on a trip requiring him to stop for sleep or rest, and was not relied on by taxpayers at trial. united states v. correll, 389 u.s. at 300, 88 s.ct. at 446.
