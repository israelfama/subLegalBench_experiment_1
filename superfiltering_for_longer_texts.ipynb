that the lender will be assured of receiving its legal due rudisell v fifth third bank 622 f2d 243 254 6th cir1980 tila clearly does not require the debtor to tender first it contemplates the creditor tendering first but upon the creditor fulfilling its obligations under the statute the debtor then must tender since rescission is an equitable remedy the court may condition the return of monies to the debtor upon the return of property to the creditor citations omitted emphasis added fdic v dev co 938 f2d 889 890 8th cir1991 tila generally provides that the creditor shall perform first ie return monies paid by the debtor and release its security interest however the act gives courts discretion to devise other procedures 15 usc  1635b including conditioning rescissions upon the debtors prior return of the principal defendant also cites to luciano v weyerhaeuser mortg co 200 fedappx 628 630 9th cir2006 however that opinion is not citable in this context pursuant to ninth circuit rule 3634 the fac alleges that the tender demand requested an itemization of the loan disbursements the loan charges the current principal balance and all payments received  so that we may determine the exact amount needed for tender see fac  52 ex 7 and that because wachovia did not respond plaintiff was not able to tender the exact and definite amount even though the court chooses to assume on this motion that such information would not also be in the hands of a typical reasonable borrower there is still no allegation in the fac of any ability to tender any amount whatsoever5 the full relevant paragraph of the yamamoto opinion statesas rescission under  1635b is an ongoing process consisting of a number of steps there is no reason why a court that may alter the sequence of procedures after deciding that rescission is warranted may not do so before deciding that rescission is warranted when it finds that assuming grounds for rescission exist rescission still could not be enforced because the borrower cannot comply with the borrowers rescission obligations no matter what such a decision lies within the courts equitable discretion taking into consideration all the circumstances including the nature of the violations and the borrowers ability to repay the proceeds if as was the case here it is clear from the evidence that the borrower lacks capacity to pay back what she has received less interest finance charges etc the court does not lack discretion to do before trial what it could do afteryamamoto 329 f3d at 11736 see also in re wepsic 231 br 768 776 sdcal 1998 the court finds that wepsics proposal of treating josephsons claim as unsecured and paying her over the course of three or more years cuts against the purpose of rescission which is to return both parties to the status quo ante quenzer v advanta mortgage corp usa 288 br 884 888 dkan2003 within the meaning of tila rescission does not mean an annulment that is definitively accomplished by unilateral pronouncement but rather a remedy that restores the status quo ante7 of course that does not mean that we limit ourselves to the provision in perfect isolation we must instead construe that provision with the statutory scheme in which it is embedded in re bce west lp 319 f3d at 11708the court notes that language in a great many cases appears garbled admittedly because cases speak of equitably

fulfilling its obligations under the statute the debtor then must tender since rescission is an equitable remedy the court may condition the return of monies to the debtor upon the return of property to the creditor citations omitted emphasis added fdic v dev co 938 f2d 889 890 8th cir1991 tila generally provides that the creditor shall perform first ie return monies paid by the debtor and release

cites to luciano v weyerhaeuser mortg co 200 fedappx 628 630 9th cir2006 however that opinion is not citable in this context pursuant to ninth circuit rule 3634 the fac alleges that the tender demand requested an itemization of the loan disbursements the loan charges the current principal balance and all payments received  so that we may determine the exact amount needed for tender see fac  52 ex 7 and that because wachovia did not respond plaintiff was not able to tender the exact and definite amount even though the court chooses to assume on this motion that such information would not also be in the hands of a typical reasonable borrower there is still no allegation in the fac of any ability to tender any amount whatsoever5 the full relevant paragraph of the yamamoto opinion statesas rescission under  1635b is an ongoing process consisting of a number of steps there is no reason why a court that may alter the sequence of procedures after deciding that rescission is warranted may not do so before deciding that rescission is warranted when it finds that assuming grounds for rescission exist rescission still could not be enforced because the borrower cannot comply with the borrowers rescission obligations no matter what such a decision lies within the courts equitable discretion taking into consideration all the circumstances including the nature of the violations and the borrowers ability to repay the proceeds if as was the case here it is clear from the evidence that the borrower lacks capacity to pay back what she has received less interest finance charges etc the court does not lack discretion to do before trial what it could do afteryamamoto 329 f3d at 11736 see also in re wepsic 231 br 768 776 sdcal 1998 the court finds that wepsics proposal of treating josephsons claim as unsecured and paying her over the course of three or more years cuts against the purpose of rescission which is to return both parties to the status quo ante quenzer v advanta mortgage corp usa 288 br 884 888 dkan2003 within the meaning of tila rescission does not mean an annulment that is definitively accomplished by unilateral pronouncement but rather a remedy that restores the status quo ante7 of course that does not mean that we limit ourselves to the provision in perfect isolation we must instead construe that provision with the statutory scheme in which it is embedded in re bce west lp 319 f3d at 11708the court notes that language in a great many cases appears garbled admittedly because cases speak of equitably conditioning the rescission even though what they really are talking about is equitably modifying the conditioned procedural order in which tila says a rescission will place see eg fdic v hughes development co inc 938 f2d 889 890 8th

do hold is that when rescission is attempted under circumstances which would deprive the lender of its legal due the attempted rescission will not be judicially enforced unless it is so conditioned that the lender will be assured of receiving its legal due rudisell v fifth third bank 622 f2d 243 254 6th cir1980 tila clearly does not require the debtor to tender first it contemplates the creditor tendering first but upon the creditor fulfilling its obligations under the statute the debtor then must tender since rescission is an equitable remedy the court may condition the return of monies to the debtor upon the return of property to the creditor citations omitted emphasis added fdic v dev co 938 f2d 889 890 8th cir1991 tila generally provides that the creditor shall perform first ie return monies paid by the debtor and release its security interest however the act gives courts discretion to devise other procedures 15 usc  1635b including conditioning rescissions upon the debtors prior return of the principal defendant also cites to luciano v weyerhaeuser mortg co 200 fedappx 628 630 9th cir2006 however that opinion is not citable in this context pursuant to ninth circuit rule 3634 the fac alleges that the tender demand requested an itemization of the loan disbursements the loan charges the current principal balance and all payments received  so that we may determine the exact amount needed for tender see fac  52 ex 7 and that because wachovia did not respond plaintiff was not able to tender the exact and definite amount even though the court chooses to assume on this motion that such information would not also be in the hands of a typical reasonable borrower there is still no allegation in the fac of any ability to tender any amount whatsoever5 the full relevant paragraph of the yamamoto opinion statesas rescission under  1635b is an ongoing process consisting of a number of steps there is no reason why a court that may alter the sequence of procedures after deciding that rescission is warranted may not do so before deciding that rescission is warranted when it finds that assuming grounds for rescission exist rescission still could not be enforced because the borrower cannot comply with the borrowers rescission obligations no matter what such a decision lies within the courts equitable discretion taking into consideration all the circumstances including the nature of the violations and the borrowers ability to repay the proceeds if as was the case here it is clear from the evidence that the borrower lacks capacity to pay back what she has received less interest finance charges etc the court does not lack discretion to do before trial what it could do afteryamamoto 329 f3d at 11736 see also in re wepsic 231 br 768 776 sdcal 1998 the court finds that wepsics proposal of treating josephsons claim as unsecured and paying her over the course of three or more years cuts against the purpose of rescission which is to return both parties to the status quo ante quenzer v advanta mortgage corp usa 288 br 884 888 dkan2003 within the meaning of tila rescission does not mean an annulment that is definitively accomplished by unilateral pronouncement but rather a remedy that restores the status quo ante7 of course that does not mean that we limit ourselves to the provision in perfect isolation we must instead construe that provision with the statutory scheme in which it is embedded in re bce west lp 319 f3d at 11708the court notes that language in a great many cases appears garbled admittedly because cases speak of equitably conditioning the rescission even though what they really are talking about is equitably modifying the conditioned procedural order in which tila says a rescission will place see eg fdic v hughes development co inc 938 f2d 889 890 8th cir1991 but as previously discussed while not a model of clarity in some respects the statutory and regulatory language at issue do seem to state fairly clearly irrespective of whether or not a security interest is terminated before or after a tender that money received by borrowers shall be tendered back at some procedural point9 one allegation by plaintiff deserves a more detailed response in this regard first plaintiff makes a serious allegation that the promissory note and the deed of trust for the mortgage transaction listed different amounts see fac  21 stating the amount of the loan in the note dated february 21 2008 was 44000000 the amount secured by the deed of trust dated february 21 2008 was 55000000 see also fac  19 62 this might appear to rise to the level of fraudulence required for equitable tolling though it is unclear whether it would represent a tila violation still plaintiff calls this the most glaring tila violation of defendants october 5 opposition 615 even to the extent such a discrepancy would relate to a tila violation and even to the extent if so that it would not have been apparent at the consummation of the transaction hubbard 91 f3d at 79 plaintiff has attached the purported note exhibit 2 and the purported deed of trust exhibit 3 to her fac and these documents controvert the alleged facts in the fac a court may disregard allegations in the complaint if contradicted by facts established by exhibits attached to the complaint see eg sumner peck ranch 823 fsupp at 720 the attached deed of trust in fact shows an original principal amount of us 44000000 plus accrued and deferred interest and such other amounts as stated in the note fac exhibit 3 deed of trust part 1d the note likewise is a promise to pay us 44000000 called principal plus interest and any other charges incurred during the course of the loan fac exhibit 2 page 1 the 55000000 referenced by the deed of trust is the maximum aggregate principal balance secured by this deed of trust which is 125 of the original principal note amount fac exhibit 3 deed of trust p 1 this is the analogue provision to paragraph 3f of the note which provides my unpaid principal balance can never exceed 125 of the principal i originally borrowed fac exhibit 2 p 3 paragraph 3f consequently even to the extent a plaintiff would not notice such a discrepancy at the time of consummation of the transaction the facs allegations thus contradicted do not give rise to the sort of fraud that might toll the limitations period10 plaintiff also cites nonbinding outofstate and outofcircuit authority in the fac rather than in her opposition for the proposition that the oneyear statute of limitations does not apply when tila claims are asserted as a defense to a nonjudicial foreclosure claim at least one district court in this circuit has recently reached the opposite conclusion see ortiz v accredited home lenders inc 639 fsupp2d 1159 116465 sdcal200911 there is no 15 usc  1692a6fiii and the court assumes generously to the plaintiff that she meant to make allegations relating to 15 usc  1692a6fiii12 defendant has asked the court to take judicial notice 1 of other cases that treated wachovia mortgage fsb as a federal savings bank regulated by the office of thrift supervision and subject to hola 2 (E) holding that the judicial admission exception did not apply to prove the existence of an oral agreement for the sale of stock where the defendant offered his deposition testimony acknowledging that the parties agreed to have a document transferring the stocks drafted by an attorney because the defendants references to the agreement were in terms of a tentative or incomplete agreement and because any admission of such a contract would necessarily have to include a statement of the price and quantity terms.\n","Output: (Tokens: 5309)\n","Output: holding failure to allege defendant is a debt collector defeats a fdcpa

the court does not lack discretion to do before trial what it could do afteryamamoto 329 f3d at 11736 see also in re wepsic 231 br 768 776 sdcal 1998 the court finds that wepsics proposal of treating

mortgage corp usa 288 br 884 888 dkan2003 within the meaning of tila rescission does not mean an annulment that is definitively accomplished by unilateral pronouncement but rather a remedy that restores the status quo ante7 of course that does not mean that we limit ourselves to the provision in perfect isolation we must instead construe that provision with the statutory scheme in which it is embedded in re bce west lp 319 f3d at 11708the court notes that language in a great many cases appears garbled admittedly because cases speak of equitably conditioning the rescission even though what they really are talking about is equitably modifying the conditioned procedural order in which tila says a rescission will place see eg fdic v hughes development co inc 938 f2d 889 890 8th cir1991 but as previously discussed while not a model of clarity in some respects the statutory and regulatory language at issue do seem to state fairly clearly irrespective of whether or not a security interest is terminated before or after a tender that money received by borrowers shall be tendered back at some procedural point9 one allegation by plaintiff deserves a more detailed response in this regard first plaintiff makes a serious allegation that the promissory note and the deed of trust for the mortgage transaction listed different amounts see fac  21 stating the amount of the loan in the note dated february 21 2008 was 44000000 the amount secured by the deed of trust dated february 21 2008 was 55000000 see also fac  19 62 this might appear to rise to the level of fraudulence required for equitable tolling though it is unclear whether it would represent a tila violation still plaintiff calls this the most glaring tila violation of defendants october 5 opposition 615 even to the extent such a discrepancy would relate to a tila violation and even to the extent if so that it would not have been apparent at the consummation of the transaction hubbard 91 f3d at 79 plaintiff has attached the purported note exhibit 2 and the purported deed of trust exhibit 3 to her fac and these documents controvert the alleged facts in the fac a court may disregard allegations in the complaint if contradicted by facts established by exhibits attached to the complaint see eg sumner peck ranch 823 fsupp at 720 the attached deed of trust in fact shows an original principal amount of us 44000000 plus accrued and deferred interest and such other amounts as stated in the note fac exhibit 3 deed of trust part 1d the note likewise is a promise to pay us 44000000 called principal plus interest and any other charges incurred during the course of the loan fac exhibit 2 page 1 the 55000000 referenced by the deed of trust is the maximum aggregate principal balance secured by this deed of trust which is 125 of the original principal note amount fac exhibit 3 deed of trust p 1 this is the analogue provision to paragraph 3f of the note which provides my unpaid principal balance can never exceed 125 of the principal i originally borrowed fac exhibit 2 p 3 paragraph 3f consequently even to the extent a plaintiff would not notice such a discrepancy at the time of consummation of the transaction the facs allegations thus contradicted do not give rise to the sort of fraud that might toll the limitations period10 plaintiff also cites nonbinding outofstate and outofcircuit authority in the fac rather than in her opposition for the proposition that the oneyear statute of limitations does not apply when tila claims are asserted as a defense to a nonjudicial

Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb.

See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another.

Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb. Felony offenses that involve explosives qualify as “violent crimes” for purposes of enhancing the sentences of career offenders. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another.

Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb.

See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another.

Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb. Felony offenses that involve explosives qualify as “violent crimes” for purposes of enhancing the sentences of career offenders. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another.

Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb. Felony offenses that involve explosives qualify as “violent crimes” for purposes of enhancing the sentences of career offenders. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another.

On the resentencing forms, the court included the abbreviation “CTS,” which meant credit for time served when construed consistently with the trial court’s oral pronouncement of the sentence. Although Kaylor argues that the resentencing form also contained the phrase “above and beyond,” which has been disapproved of in some contexts, the court’s statements at the resentencing hearing sufficiently explained that Kaylor would receive credit for time previously served, and that the 20-year sentence was not in addition to the time previously served.
